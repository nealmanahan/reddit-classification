# Project 3 - Reddit Post Classification and Natural Language Processing

## Overview

For this project, I was asked to analyze data and create a model that will predict which subreddit a post was taken from. 

## Problem Statement

The following three questions drove my work on the project:

- How accurately can we predict whether a subreddit post comes from the r/hiphopheads or r/country categories?
- What words are best to be used to reach the ‘top’ charts on each subreddit?
- What is the best tone (polarity) of post titles to place on the ‘top’ chart?
