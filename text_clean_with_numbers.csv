**Final Thoughts**

i have seen some really fucked up shit today in my inbox about his death and just know right now is not the time for that, for now it is better to say nothing. On the topic of death, death comes wherever it wants, any minute. He was only 20 and no 20 year old deserves to be gunned down in the street like that. May he find peace in his passing.

As some of y’all know, my name is brandUn DeShay. I produced a lot of songs over the years but the ones we’re talking about today are “School High” & “Last Cypher”.

It's been almost 2 MONTHS since I heard from Joey Bada$$ yall....
I wanna give him the benefit of the doubt that he's a much busier man than me these days, but I've also reached out to his label management over the last 5 months and still no reply.

These beats I produced for Joey were done when I was 2 or 3 yrs in and for years these songs remained FREE mixtape downloads and I had no problem with that. I never asked for bread because technically no one was getting paid.

Until recently (December 12/23/18) Joey re-released the PEEP the Aprocalypse mixtape on all streaming platforms. Therefore generating bread off streams and DID NOT ask my permission, did not do splits or even work out a deal to just buy my share of the publishing from me.

To me, if you making money off the work/effort of another man, make sure that man eating too 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

And I hate takin shit like this public cuz usually i think that shit is corny asf... butttt I'm still tryna avoid taking this to court to retrieve the 💰. 

I hope Joey reaches back so we can figure this out... the ""producer x rapper"" relationship in Hip-Hop deserves some success stories.

Please retweet or share if this resonates at all.

EDIT: 

not to sound condescending but i'm just gonna add a couple of discussion questions here incase y'all get tired of 'father stretch my anus' jokes and lyric chains:

What direction do you think ~~this album is~~ these albums are going to take? What direction would you like to see them take? Do you think the length of the album is good or bad? What influences are we supposed to see on the album? Do you think he's gonna release it in time?


We know he's let Charlamagne hear some of it, and I believe Nas reportedly was working on something with Kanye too, what do you think it is? 

edit 2: 

why didn't kanye tweet the name of his own album? I'm assuming the second one is Kids See Ghost - Kids See Ghost

Why is ghost singular? do you expect both the drop? which one do you think will sell more?

EDIT: TAYLOR RESPONDED ITS FUCKING LIT: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BH_TCz4DeSj/

*Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me 'that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. i wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for m, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I never asked to be a part of, since 2009.*

So first her PR team say there was no phone call, suddenly she never heard a certain part.

Also here's a better video of the snapchat story, credit /u/Pootrick2: https://flipagram.com/f/sfbgiK4bPf

**Every snapchat vid is Kanye talking to Taylor or vice versa over the phone.**

**Snapchat 1**  
Kanye: Oh ok do, you still got- you still got the Nashville number?  
Taylor: I do still have the Nashville area code but, I had to change it

**Snapchat 2**  
Kanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best... I feel like me and Taylor, might still have sex

**Snapchat 3**  
Taylor: I'm like, this close to over exposure  
Kanye: Oh, well this one is uh, this is a really cool thing to have uhh  
Taylor: I know! **It's like a compliment kind of**

**Snapchat 4**  
Kanye: .. give a fuck about... is just you as a person and as a friend, I want things that you feel good, I don;'t wanna do rap that makes you feel bad

**Snapchat 5**  
Taylor: Umm yeah I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way

**Snapchat 6**  
Taylor: I really appreciate you telling me about it! That's really nice.  
Kanye: Uh, yeah I just feel like I had a responsibility to you as a friend, I mean

**Snapchat 7**  
Kanye: I mean, thanks for being like so cool about it  
Taylor: Aww thanks, I really appreciate it, like the heads up is, that is so nice

**Snapchat 8**  
Taylor: Even asking or seeing if I'm being ok with it, I really appreciate, like I'd never had expected you to tell me about a line your song

**Snapchat 9**  
Taylor: The flowers that you sent me! I like, instagrammed a picture of them and its the most instagram likes I've ever gotten like 2.7

**Snapchat 10**  
Kanye: Relationships more important than punchlines, you know

**Snapchat 11**  
Taylor: Yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and think ""Oh that's a real bit, he must be crying""

**Snapchat 12**  
Taylor: You gotta tell the story like the way it happened to you and the way you experienced it, like you honestly didn't know who I was before that

**Snapchat 13**  
Taylor: It doesn't matter if I sold seven million off that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that, that's fine. 

**Snapchat 14**  
Taylor: And then you get (cant hear) that to make these things happen, and I have the idea to do it, and I create these things and concepts, it's like, I'm always gonna respect you

**Snapchat 15**  
Taylor: And I'm really glad that, you had the respect to call me and tell me about the song and

**Snapchat 16**    
Taylor: It's just like, it's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship so thank you  
Kanye: Thanks you too

**Snapchat 17**  
Taylor: If people ask me about it, it would be great to tell, well he called me and told me before it came out, jokes on you guys, we're fine

**Snapchat 18**    
Taylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade, but I'm gonna be on the Grammy red carpet and theyre gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me

**Snapchat 19**  - (I'm feeling like the FBI rn lmao)    
Taylor: ...awesome that youre so outspoken, they’re gonna be like “yeah she does, it made her famous.” you know. it’s more provocative to say “might still have sex.”

**Snapchat 20**  
No sound! Kanye isn't moving his lips so it's Taylor again talking but Kim must have messed up

**Snapchat 21**  
Taylor: It's not, *sighs* it's not, it doesn't matter to me, **there's not one line there that hurts my feelings**

**Taylor fans in dungerees n shambles tbh fam**

btw cheers for the gold lmao 

tonight has been a wild fucking ride...

Fuck I couldn't stop laughing .. he was always there in the middle of the best moments .. and if there wasn't a vibe he created it and made the room brighter .. he radiated positivity, but there wasn't a balance.. the other side was he was deeply insecure and always found substitution for what was missing in his life .. For a second think about the people around you and make sure they are always aware of the love .. don't take a second forgranted. They might need you and you don't even notice it because your too busy .. always gonna love you Mac""](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bncn-NpgdZL/?hl=en&taken-by=diplo)

>Now I’ve been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about Ye’& his antics... Partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situations dealing wit my brother Wayne (which I admittedly mishandled a bit in hindsight) But now this shit is next level,futuristic Sambo,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!! From what I can gather... This is the most repulsive,disgraceful, 
Embarrassing act of desperation & auctioning off of one’s soul to gain power I’ve ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally)... but bro... if ain’time I would’ve been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence,I feel that I’d be compelled to slap de’Fuq outta you bro For the People!!! You ass kissing and boot licking on a whole new level &I refuse to associate myself with something so vile,weak,& inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE!!!! I’m a true believer in “It ain’t what you do,it’s how you do it.” And this shit is regurgitating🤮! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you... now, I’m ashamed to have ever been associated with you.
To all the people who follow Ye musically,socially, or even personally....who are confused, heartbroken, infuriated.... Let me make this clear... THIS SHIT AINT COOL!!! THIS IS A MOVE YE MADE FOR YE!!! THIS IS A PLAY TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION HE’D LIKE TO SEE HIMSELF IN...WE ARE NOT ON HIS MIND AS HE MAKES THESE COMMENTS AND DECISIONS. Don’t follow this puppet. Because as long as I’ve lived I’ve learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world,if to do so he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr.West’s Soul on auction. If you listen closely you can hear the tears of our ancestors hit the floor. All I can say is... I’ve reached my limits. This is my stop,I’m officially DONE!!!! 🖕🏽Trump & His Lil Cookie Boy. #USorELSE✊🏽

[It appears Drake is trying to clear 'Say What's Real' off his So Far Gone mixtape. This song samples/remixes Kanye's 'Say You Will'](https://i.imgur.com/Pu6G3DV.jpg)

Kanye took this as the opportunity to air out Drake, citing all the sneak disses and behind the scenes threats he's alleged that he's made. In the span of his rants, he's claimed Drake bought out Pusha T's front rows in Toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on SICKO MODE, Drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for Drake to end the first rant by calling him.

Kanye claimed 'Mission Accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. A couple hours later, Kanye is back and claiming Drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that XXX is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is Kanye is a family man. Kanye says he paved the way for Drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. Essentially, respect your elders.

And then gives a further deep dive into SICKO MODE, calling out Travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. Retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here.

shots fired peep this fucking beef at my music school...,11912,46wshm,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 46wshm shots_fired_peep_this_fucking_beef_at_my_music ,1700,1456082691.0,"Some background:
So I go to Berklee in Boston. I'm the second person to ever get in for rapping, so I'm blessed with a lot of really great opportunities and talent to work with. I've been working on a project since I got here I was supposed to release friday. 

Wednesday night, I get linked from a few band members this kid who I'd vaguely seen twice had written a diss track on me, posted it everywhere. All the class pages, the fucking secret Boston page, twitter-- everywhere. 

Here's that: https://soundcloud.com/kiswamusic/back-and-forth

I STRAIGHT UP THOUGHT THIS HAD TO BE SOME FUCKING JOKE. The times I had seen this dude, I'd been super fucking nice to him. I'd seen him a week earlier like ""yo, lets chill and catch up. No business for once."" I thought this dude was trying to just get people hype. So I write a quick 16 response but don't record it yet. Then he decides to post all this shit on Facebook like ""Zaid's a bitch"", walk around campus talking a mess of shit about me. Keep in mind, Berklee is a big fucking music school-- a lot of these people get jobs in the industry-- it's a huge networking hub. That's my reputation he's DIRECTLY impacting. SO I write a fuck ton more, we get the three best producers in the school to collab on the track and respond: 

https://soundcloud.com/zaidtmusic/the-last-supperkiswa-diss

1 for 1. Did it that night, we got a studio and recorded it.

Here's the thing. I had no idea how big of a fucking deal this was around Berklee. Fucking teachers were asking students about it. Everybody was talking about it. I straight up walked into the 150 lobby to applause yo. There's meme's of this dude on a bunch of peoples profiles with his face photoshopped on a fucking cucumber. 

http://imgur.com/jgcWGP7

11am I receive a text from said bodied motherfucker going like

""It was a publicity stunt. Nothing personal, just wanted to see how I could manipulate a fanbase""

LOL. foh. I told him to take the L and apologize for some stupid shit he couldn't deal with. He's like ""nah, best decision I ever made"". I'm like ""STRAIGHT"". Ima be real, I started battling a long ass time ago, and there are motherfuckers who understand where they're at-- take the L and squash, and people too stupid to understand it. Everytime I've lost a battle, I've been real about it like ""yo, good shit, I'ma come back harder."" I leave it be. But this dude too stupid to see that not only did he burn one bridge, he burned pretty much all of them at this school because he started some unnecessary shit. And then came around and started messaging people 
""oh no I didn't mean it!""

idk, i just wanted to share with ya'll some hilarious shit, because I've popped up on here a couple times, and I thought it was worth the story. And the dude does look like a motherfucking cucumber. 

TL;DR: I go to Berklee for rapping and some kid wrote a diss track on me. I responded. A lot of people knew about it. Now everybody talks about how this kid looks like a cucumber. And I posted it here because I thought it was funny, and ya'll are family. 

**UPDATE: HOLY SHIT! HAD NO IDEA YA'LL this was gonna get so big. Appreciate the praise, criticism, all that. My project is dropping monday or tuesday, pm me and i'll shoot you a link. and here's a link to another song I did a few months back: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3MAsOrOxg**

I've seen a lot of hip hop shows, a lot of underground acts and this was the first show I was going to see a ""mumble rapper"". After seeing all his show footage it seemed like it'd be madness and I been following Lil Purp for over a year now. So we went to Starland Ballroom in NJ last night to go see him. Not only did I sit through 3 and a half hours of the worst openers I've ever seen, but the DJs were playing obnoxiously long sets with Lil Pump, XXX, and Ski Mask on repeat... but they were the same 3 songs. That's Okay, I thought, it's basically time for Smokepurpp.

Not only did they keep saying one more song. Then three more songs and he'll come out.... He came out late as hell and he was leaning and geeked so hard.

Here's his set list (did not play any of these all the way thru):
Audi,
Geek A Lot,
Bless Yo Trap,
Drop,
Fingers Blue,
Audi (again)

What the fuck. I sat through 3.5 hours for a fucking 15 min set... where he played Audi twice. Not to mention 2 other songs he played in his set were Uzi and Waka songs.

Aftwr taking so long he said ""theres no rules for lil purpp""... I feel like I was finessed by an artist I actually really fuck with. I'm pretty tight. 

Tl/dr; Smokepurpp doesn't give a fuck about his fans dont go see him. Go see an artist that'll put on an actual show. 

EDIT: I am not saying fuck Smokepurpp I still think the dude makes enjoyable music, just a little warning to anyone thinkin about spending time or money at one of his shows.",2017-12-28 09:58:54,1

I hope this isn't breaking the HHH rules, but here goes - I wrote a Python app that uses Markov Chains to write its own randomly-generated rap songs (based on *real* rap lyrics that I scraped from RapGenius).

Hope you enjoy - check it out! The app has some memory and timeout issues, but I'm working to fix them. Happy to answer any questions!

EDIT: Looks like it got Reddit-hugg'd-to-death. I'm trying to clear some memory to get the app back up. Glad everyone's liking it!

EDIT2: Wow, thanks a ton for all your support. I'm honestly pretty blown away - was not expecting this level of feedback. Apologies for the app still being finicky!

"r. kelly's former lawyer calls him ""guilty as hell,"" made him take ""libido-killing shots"" and re-wrote ""ignition"" to avoid conviction",10285,ayu1mb,reddit  r hiphopheads ments ayu1mb r_kellys_former_lawyer_calls_him_guilty_as_hell ,799,1552072308.0,"Kelly's former lawyer, Ed Genson, is retired and basically on his death bed and all out of fucks to give. The [*Chicago Sun-Times*](https://chicago.suntimes.com/?post_type=cst_article&p=1920405&utm_campaign=ChicagoSunTimes&utm_content=1551998192&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) has a really interesting [interview](https://chicago.suntimes.com/?post_type=cst_article&p=1920405&utm_campaign=ChicagoSunTimes&utm_content=1551998192&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) with the guy who represented R. Kelly in his 2008 child pornography trial.

In addition to calling his former client ""guilty as hell,"" he details some extreme and surprising measures he took to help keep Kelly ""out of trouble for 10 years."" Here are some choice excerpts:

>*“He was guilty as hell!” Genson said. “I don’t think he’s done anything inappropriate for years. I’ll tell you a secret: I had him go to a doctor to get shots, libido-killing shots. That’s why he didn’t get arrested for anything else.”*

&#x200B;

>*That’s why, Genson said, he knew Kelly was attracted to young girls. Because of lyrics Genson kept Kelly from using.*  
>  
>*“I was riding in the car, listening to a song and said, ‘Are you crazy? This is all I need.’ He re-wrote it.”*  
>  
>*Which song?*  
>  
>*“Ignition,” Genson said. “It’s a song related to a guy driving around in a car with his girlfriend. It was originally a high school instructor in a class teaching people how to drive a car. I changed the words.”*

Does Ed Genson deserve a song-writing or production credit for ""Ignition?""

EDIT: Son of Super-Lawyer weighs in: 

>*Genson’s son, Morton Genson, said Friday that he believed his dad wasn’t thinking clearly when he gave the interview at his home in Deerfield, Ill.*  
>  
>*He said his dad has been “in and out of the hospital” and returned for another stay shortly after the interview a few weeks ago.*  
>  
>*“He’s on a tremendous amount of medication,” Morton told the Daily News Friday when asked about the comments.*

**Background** by u/A_Wavvy_Dude


Kids See Ghosts is an American hip-duo consisting of two of the most important and influential artists of this generation: Scott Mescudi, also known as [Kid Cudi](https://i.imgur.com/UCzqoEv.jpg), and [Kanye West](http://i.imgur.com/oB2WbVy.jpg). You know who they are. Kanye and Cudi's relationship is complicated to say the least, full of meteoric highs and heartbreaking lows, and the lead up to the formation and release of Kids See Ghosts is no different. 

Kanye and Cudi would first begin working with each other in 2008, thanks to Kid Cudi catching Kanye's attention from the release of his massively successful debut single ""Day'n' Nite"". Cudi is soon summoned by Ye to help with the recording of his fourth studio album and one of the most important albums of the decade: *808s and Heartbreaks*. After the tragic and unnecessary death of his mother due to a freak accident that happened during a surgery he helped pay for, coupled with the breaking off of his engagement mere months after this, 808s finds Kanye at his lowest and most emotionally vulnerable state yet. With Kid Cudi providing songwriting on four tracks and being featured on two, Kanye and Cudi would go on to change the landscape of hip hop with *808s and Heartbreaks*, showing not only general audiences but fellow rappers as well that being emotional and ""in your feelings"" is not only cathartic, but commercially viable as well.

The success of *808s and Heartbreaks* and the obvious artistic chemistry between Ye and Cudi led to a long collaborative partnership between the two, with Cudi subsequently appearing on every one of Kanye's solo albums released after 808s and Kanye being featured on multiple Kid Cudi tracks, including ""Erase Me"". 

In September of 2016, 7 months after the release of Kanye's seventh studio album *The Life of Pablo* which once again would feature him on the lead single Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1, Kid Cudi would go on a [twitter rant](http://i.imgur.com/72WXYCu.png) calling out Kanye and Drake by saying that they and other artists didn't care about him unless they want something from him. After hearing this while on the Saint Pablo tour in Tampa, Kanye calls out Cudi over the tweets, telling him to [""Never mention Ye name""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujQimOELtLU) and that he ""birthed"" Cudi. To fans of either artists, these interactions were heartbreaking as the two were viewed as inseparable ever since their first collaboration. During the weeks leading up to the release of his new album, *Passion, Pain, & Demon Slayin'*, it was soon revealed by Kid Cudi on his facebook page that he was checking himself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges, which also explained his erratic behavior on twitter leading up to this moment. After Cudi's eventual release from rehab, him and Kanye would reunite back on stage to perform Father Stretch My Hands together, [ending in a tearful embrace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq5IF7AUR0w). That same night, due to the pressures of tour life and fame in general, not to mention the recent mugging of his wife in Paris heavily weighing on him, Kanye would go on a 20 minute, manic rant about radio lying to us (""Radio fuck you""), Kid Cudi being the greatest, how he was putting his life at risk by ranting, asking Jay Z to not send shooters after him, and many other topics. He would end the show early and cancel the remaining 22 dates of the Saint Pablo tour. The next day Kanye would end up hospitalized after appearing at his physicians house and acting so erratic that his physician thought calling the police was necessary, telling 911 he needed help with a ""male with mental illness"". This mental illness would later be revealed by Kanye to be bipolar disorder. 

Almost an entire year would pass by with radio silence from both artists. As the months passed with no word, reports of Kanye recording his new album in the mountains of Wyoming began piling up and with long time collaborator Takashi Murakami -the artist of Graduation's album cover- [posting a picture of himself with Cudi and Ye](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXpojsyF6i9/?taken-by=takashipom), it was apparent that Yeezy season was steadily approaching, and hopefully with a healthier and happier Ye and Cudi. 

Even more time would pass after these reports and still with no official word from either artist about their upcoming projects. That is until Kanye made his return to Twitter and announced the upcoming releases of not one, not two, but FIVE projects, with Kanye executive producing all of them. These five albums would all be 7 tracks long and none would have a runtime of over 30 minutes, with most only reaching the 24 minute threshold. These five albums would include *Daytona* by Pusha T, Kanye's eighth studio album *Ye*, the highly anticipated collaborative album from Kanye West and Kid Cudi *Kids See Ghosts*, Teyanna Taylor's sophomore album *K.T.S.E.*, and Nas' first album in six years *Nasir*.

Taking his own lyric of ""Soon as they like you make em unlike you"" literally, the weeks leading up to the release of Kids See Ghosts would be filled with controversy due to Kanye being 100% back on his bullshit. He would publicly fully endorse President Trump (despite admitting that he knows nothing about politics or Trump's policies), calling him his brother and posting a picture of himself wearing a MAGA hat on twitter, a move that would baffle even the most diehard Ye fans. Literally a week after this, Kanye makes a surprise appearance on TMZ to make his infamous ""slavery was a choice comment"" causing even more backlash. Not even the Yeezy Defense Force could reasonably defend what Kanye was saying and doing around this time, and many Ye fans were just anxiously waiting for the music to drop. 

Finally on June 8th, a week after the release of *Ye*, an album with incredibly introspective and personal lyrics touching on themes of mental health, fatherhood, and fame, Kids See Ghosts' debut album is released. In the huge discography between the two artists, where does KSG rank?

**Review** by u/A_Wavvy_Dude

Clocking in at a mere 24 minutes with only 7 tracks, it is baffling how much of a complete and cohesive project *Kids See Ghosts* sounds like with such little content. Kanye and Cudi bring out the absolute best of each other on this album, and the chemistry between the two is palpable. Kanye (with assistance from Cudi and long time collaborators Dot Da Genius, Mike Dean, and Plain Pat, just to name a few) brought his A game for the production on this album. This album mixes hip hop, jazz, hard rock, and even grunge to create a soundscape that is both very reminiscent of the old ""chop up the beat Kanye"" from the *College Dropout* era yet is also very experimental and new at the same time. Ye also doesn't slack in the bars department, giving us some of his most charismatic, quotable, and socially conscious verses since *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*. Regarding the other half of the duo, Cudi's singing and rapping is so incredibly on point and consistent throughout the entire album. No human should be able to sound *this* on pitch and make it look so easy while simultaneously giving some of his best verses in nearly a decade but Mr. Rager somehow manages to do it all while gifting us with his legendary hums, hums so iconic that Cudi's feature on Travis Scott's *Astroworld* was almost exclusively just him humming. 

You only need to look at the eclectic, bizarre, and psychedelic cover art by Takashi Murakami to see the kind of tonal and sonic direction that *Kids See Ghosts is going for*. This album is an experimental hip hop opus that tackles mental illness and self acceptance in a way no other hip hop album preceding it has done before. Kanye had stated in his almost 2 hour long interview with Charlamagne that he wanted to create music that was therapeutic, and *Kids See Ghosts* is the absolute definition of this. *Kids See Ghosts* sees Kanye and Cudi facing and accepting their respective ""ghosts"" that have been haunting them in the hopes of overcoming their trauma filled pasts. Although their mental illnesses will never fully disappear, they can work towards the goal of not letting their handicaps control them and to continue moving forward as creatives and as people, and I believe the music on this album displays this sentiment beautifully. Also Kanye makes gunshot noises for like 3 minutes.

The album begins with the incredibly energetic and anthemic ""**Feel the Love**"" featuring Pusha T. The track opens with Kid Cudi shouting out from the highest limit of his upper register ""I CAN STILL FEEL THE LOVE"" over a very dreary set of synth chords. It sounds like Cudi climbed the highest mountain peak on earth and is shouting down on us with everything he's got this mantra of staying positive and continuing to feel the love despite past mistakes. This chorus and its constant, echoing repetition throughout the track is instantly infectious and immediately catches the listeners ear. Pusha T then casually saunters onto the track and, with his usual Push bravado, delivers a very short but braggadocious verse about how easy winning is for him and enjoying the excesses of fame. Just as we're getting comfortable and settling into the vibe of the song, Kanye, before Push is even done with his verse, almost as if he's chomping at the bit to start going ballistic, jumps in and starts making these insane gunshot sounds in sync with these cracking snares in the background as the instrumental progresses into a marching rhythm of heavy drum beats. It's ridiculous, it's chaotic, and it is hype as hell. After Kanye's outburst of gunshots the instrumental then breaks down into some downtrodden guitar and bass leads, giving the listener a chance to catch their breath until Kanye reappears to angrily demand ""WHERE THE CHORUS"", a question Cudi happily answers as he breaks back out into the chorus once again. The instrumental then returns to its marching rhythm as Kanye closes the track out by once again making his erratic gunshot sounds. A song that takes *this* many sudden sonic turns should have ended up being an absolute mess, but somehow it manages to sound sharply focused and meticulously crafted. 

The second and shortest track on the album, titled ""**Fire**"", is a prime example of Kanye's eclectic sample choices and how he can craft a beat out of something no one would have ever expected, sampling the marching, tambourine laden beat from a 1966 novelty song called ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"" by the artist Napoleon XIV. Laced over this sample is some very ominous flute work and faintly in the background is what sounds like a distorted, untuned guitar riffing away, all while Cudi's foreboding hums hang around the instrumental. This track is essentially an anti-hater anthem, as Kanye starts his verse off by saying ""I love all your shit talkin"", basically saying that the hate and criticism that he receives just pushes him to become a better artist in the end. To me the most standout thing about Kanye's verse on this track is how absolutely *hungry* he sounds here. He raps with such an overwhelming amount of authority and confidence that makes you hang off of every word he's saying. After, Ye's verse, Cudi follows soon after and does a fantastic job of keeping the energy going and continues the lyrical theme of ignoring the hate that is surrounding him as he tries to overcome the pain from his past. He then plays the song out with a beautiful and forlorn outro in which he reflects on the ""scars he left behind"" and turns to religion to help show him guidance, a recurring topic on the album. If I had to choose one, this is probably my least favorite track on the album and that's most likely attributed to the brevity of the track since it feels like not a lot really happens during the track's short runtime. That being said, this is still a pretty fantastic song that just isn't as fantastic as some of the other tracks on here. 

After this is the appropriately titled third track ""**4th Dimension**"", which sounds like exactly that, something that has come from a foreign and unknown plane of existence, and it is arguably the best track on the project. Once again we have Kanye using an off the wall sample choice for the foundation of the track, taking a vocal sample from a 1936 Christmas song titled ""What Will Santa Claus Say?"" by Louis Prima (credited as a feature on the track) and then just chopping and distorting the absolute shit out of it until we get the Frankenstein beat we see before us that gives the track a very demented and eerie feel to it. Kanye starts the track off with an explicitly raunchy verse about sex in which he relates sex to this new, indescribable dimension and speaks about it as if it's some kind of religious experience (""Now drop to your knees for the offerin""). This verse is absolutely dripping with Kanye's classic charisma and is full of hilarious one liners and witty quotables, especially the last line of his verse where he says if he gets locked up he won't finish the sent... and then the verse just ends. In between Kanye and Cudi's verses there's this really weird witch laughter that plays as the beat cuts off. I've seen a lot of people say that this laughter is awkward and kills the track for them which I think is a somewhat valid complaint but personally I think it adds to the overall eerie and mind bending nature of the track pretty well. Towards the back end of this laughter Kid Cudi hops in to give what is easily my favorite verse on the entire album. Cudi flows on this beat like it's nothing and sounds absolutely *menacing* while he does it, as if he's just begging you to give him a reason. Cudi continues the theme of being lost and losing everything due to the previous state of his mental health but simultaneously brags about creating the wave other artists are on and taking my bitch like he's Ric Flair. It's incredible. The track ends with a wink from Kanye as a sample of the Shirley Ann Lee song ""Someday"" plays and says that you only want two and a half minutes for a record, almost the exact runtime of the song. 

At the halfway point we have the spiritual successor to the track ""Ghost Town"" off of Kanye's previous album *ye* with the song titled ""**Freeee (Ghost Town Pt. 2)**"" featuring Ty Dolla $ign. For me this is where the whole concept of ""therapeutic music"" that Kanye was going for really started to materialize itself. Using a roaring guitar sample from the song ""Stark"" by UK producer Mr. Chop as the main foundation for the instrumental, this track sees Kanye, Cudi, and Ty letting go of all inhibitions and just going absolutely ballistic with their echoing, thunderous proclamations of feeling free being reverberated throughout the entire track. The whole thing sounds like this triumphant victory ballad, as if Kanye and Cudi are celebrating the defeat of their demons and their success in letting go of all earthly ties. The performances on this track are amazing and have such an intense, pulsating energy to them that it's easy to get swept up in the cathartic and rebellious nature of the track, an effect that Kanye seemingly intended with his suggestion of ""You should quit your job to this"". Ty Dolla $ign's feature is probably my favorite of the three features on the album as he delivers these characteristically buttery smooth vocal melodies but still manages to keep up with Kanye and Cudi's wild tendencies. The combination of the hard rock instrumental and the previously mentioned off the wall vocal performances makes this track feel like more of a psychedelic rock n' roll song ripped straight out of the seventies instead of your average hip hop song. Kanye himself also seems to view this song as a pure rock track, as he and Def Jam Records submitted the track for consideration in the Rock category of the 2019 Grammys, for both 'Best Rock Song' and 'Best Rock Performance'. Being a sequel/spiritual successor to Ghost Town, many of the sentiments on that track are mirrored and expounded upon in this one, with Kanye and Cudi further repeating the notion of not feeling pain anymore and transcending the constant criticism that is laid upon them and defying the boundaries set by society. 

Acting as a breather after the bombastic display of triumph that was highlighted on the previous track is the incredibly introspective and deeply personal track ""**Reborn**"", one of only two tracks on the album to not feature a Kanye production credit. This is my personal favorite off of the project and I've noticed that since the release of Kids See Ghosts this is the one track I've been coming back to the most out of all the others. The production on this track (courtesy of Cudi, benny blanco, E*Vax, Plain Pat, and Dot Da Genius) is fantastic, featuring these very playful piano notes mixed in with a lo-fi chalky beat with the whole thing being tied together by Kid Cudi's melancholic humming guiding us throughout the track. There is something so comforting about Cudi's iconic humming that instantly makes a songs atmosphere significantly more relaxing, almost as if his hums are consoling you, telling you it's okay to feel sad and that things are going to get better even though it may not seem like it. If this is what Cudi's hums represent, then nowhere are they more at home than on this track. Thematically the song is about the concept of starting anew and becoming reinvigorated after going through the process of bettering oneself and continuing to evolve as a person, or becoming ""reborn"". Cudi's singing takes center stage on this track and showcases the theme beautifully with the hook repeating that he is reborn and will keep moving forward. In his verse he reflects on the issues in his past that have brought him to this point of rebirth he now finds himself at. He muses about being lost and how having this feeling of not knowing where to go further added to his depression, until eventually realizing that happiness is something that has to come from within. As stated in the lyrics, Cudi has come a long way from past issues that have haunted him; from battling substance abuse and trying to keep custody of his child to depression and anxiety taking control of his thoughts and his life. However, now that he has been reborn he has no more stress and there's no stopping him from continuing to be the best version of himself that he can be. Then we have Kanye, also with an exceptionally introspective verse about the feeling of isolation that comes with fame and being torn between two different mental states, one being a state of manic high octane outbursts and the other being a state of low energy depression due to him being bipolar. Kanye being the public figure that he is, his fractured mental state was put on display for all to see and the results of this was the masses calling Kanye crazy, something he now views as a badge of honor. Kanye goes on to challenge anyone who's listening to continue giving him all the criticism he's been getting because no matter what people throw at him, he'll be able to take it, and he is willing to take all of the hate he receives and attempt to keep moving forward. The track ends with the beat switching up as Cudi takes the perspective of where he was before he was reborn: being lost and not knowing which way to go. However, the answer is right there, telling him to keep moving forward.

Up next is the point where the ""Ghosts"" part of *Kids See Ghosts* shows itself with the haunting title track featuring Yasiin Bey. The production of this track is absolutely hair-raising with a cloudy, speedy chord progression mixed with these very ethereal synth chords and it also has what I wanna say is a xylophone sample as well? Over this ghostly beat Yasiin Bey delivers an incredibly subdued chorus,  repeating this sentiment of kids seeing ghosts sometimes. Tremaine Emory (a friend of Kanye's and an affiliate of G.O.O.D. Music) has given some insight on the meaning of this chorus and the album title as a whole, saying ""Kids can see what adults no longer allow themselves to see"", more or less saying that kids operate at a higher state of creativity and imagination than adults do. Kid Cudi delivers a very lowkey vocal performance with a delayed echoing effect on his vocals that helps add to the overall spooky vibe of the track. He raps about being copied by other artists and once again delves into the status of his mental state, once again bringing up feeling lost and searching for something, although he feels like he's starting to run out of time because he can hear ""angels coming"". Kanye on the other hand gives a show stopping verse that is the exact opposite of lowkey, coming onto the track with a razor sharp focus rapping about religion, being greater than his competition, striving to be the best at whatever he does, and continuing to push the envelop in every way he knows how. This verse is incredibly dense with classic Yeezy quotables coming at a breakneck speed and it has that characteristic Kanye charm to it that his last album just felt like it was lacking a bit. Yasiin Bey closes the track out with a very meditative bridge where he just starts throwing out these philosophical concepts like ""civilization without society"" or ""stability without stasis."" It sounds almost like he has ascended to this plane of higher intelligence and he's attempting to share his knowledge through these brief interpolations. 

Finally we have the closing track ""**Cudi Montage**"" which contains my favorite beat out of the outstanding group of beats on here. With this being the only other song besides Reborn to not contain a Kanye production credit, this track's fantastic instrumental can be attributed to Kid Cudi, Mike Dean, and Dot Da Genius. For me what makes the production on this track so great is the fantastic use of a grimy Kurt Cobain guitar sample that makes up the majority of the instrumental here. It sounds like Cudi has finally perfected the marriage between grunge and hip hop that he was attempting to create on Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven back in 2015. Cudi opens the track with a verse continuing one of the album's themes of looking to God and religion for guidance with him rapping about the world weighing on him and only heaven can help him become stronger. In between Cudi's verse and Kanye's upcoming verse the beat begins to breakdown as the aforementioned guitar sample fades away and these gorgeous synth leads come in for Cudi to start harmonizing over. He shouts out into the cosmos for God to save him and reaffirming that he must stay strong after overcoming his past traumas. After this beautiful choral interlude we are then thrust back into the original beat of the song as Kanye gives one of his most socially conscious verses in years, describing the cycle of violence that comes with having a gang mentality and the far reaching, unforeseen damage it causes. The instrumental once again breaks down with Kanye coming in on the chorus alongside Kid Cudi to give some unexpectedly great singing as he joins Cudi in asking the Lord to help save him, closing out the track and the album with the same brilliant level of quality that we've come to expect from this duo. This is an album that is never one note, always trying something knew and succeeding every time it does. To me, this is album of the year.

And I had this moment when I looked at my phone and saw that I had him \[listed\] in there as ‘Intern.’ I asked him what he had me in his phone as. He said ‘My hero.’” — Mac Miller** ",2018-09-19 16:18:07,1

remembering /u/aacarbone,8441,8ocwot,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 8ocwot remembering_uaacarbone ,658,1528070655.0,"Hey everyone. We've got to break some sad news.

About 8 weeks ago, longtime /r/hiphopheads user and moderator /u/aacarbone passed away. aacarbone, or Andrew as those who had the chance to talk to and get to know him outside of Reddit knew him, was a big part of this community over the last several years. He was opinionated, funny, and irreverent—but with a really good heart and a penchant for being on top of social issues. Undeniably memorable to everyone who got a chance to interact with him. He loved putting other people onto music (especially 2000s rap, and *especially* Cam'ron). His last comment before he passed was shitting on Drake, and with his sense of humor we'd like to think he'd be pretty pleased about that. No one here could forget some of the funnier moments he was involved in, whether it was [getting ignored by Cam'ron in his AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/4k3hcy/i_am_killa_camronama/d3bteu5/?context=3), [offering fashion tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5f74nx/sunday_general_discussion_november_27th_2016/dahy9bd/?context=3), [stanning over Purple Haze](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/3ax24a/essential_album_of_the_week_69_camron_purple_haze/csgrdfe/), or [keeping warm-fuzzy feel-good comments about the HHH community in check](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/73u5kh/daily_discussion_thread_10022017/dnt4w76/?context=1).

His passing is a tragic loss, but the modteam thought this thread could be a way to remember and share some of the fun moments and stories members of the /r/hiphopheads community got to share with aacarbone over the last several years. And bump some Dipset songs in his memory, of course.

His mother shared the cause of his death with us in a message—and as aacarbone was always willing to be open about his struggles with sobriety in our Sunday General Discussions and talk to others who faced similar struggles in our little community (as well as sharing his goals and dreams and life updates with us), we felt it was alright for us to share it with the rest of you.

>I think it's nice to have the people who appreciated him know what happened and have the opportunity to say something. I suspect there's some speculation as to the cause of his death and I will tell ya'll that it was due to cocaine laced with fentanyl. He had no idea it was laced and had even googled ""what does heroin look like"" so he knew something wasn't right but didn't know what it was. He obviously didn't know it would kill him. I'm telling ya'll this because I had never heard of this but apparently it's becoming more common for drug dealers to mix fentanyl with other drugs- possibly even unintentionally from residue left on the scale or something like that. Pretty scary stuff- just a little bit can kill someone.

>In the obituary it does list a charity that people could donate to. It's a good charity that our expanded family started many years ago for children with serious illnesses. The people who run it do it as a passion project so there's little fees involved, leaving about 95% of donations to go directly to people who need the money. We set up a fund in his name for people who struggle with sobriety for any reason- and hopefully that will be used to help some young people who have no other resources or hope.

[His obituary is here](http://www.courant.com/obituaries/hc-obituary-andrew-riley-carbone-20180414-story.html), and if anyone wishes to do so, a link to the charity to send donations to in Andrew's name is included.

>Andrew lived a short life, but he knew so much. With his wonderful grin always at the ready, he knew how to laugh and make others laugh. With his big heart, he knew how to give love and unstinting loyalty to friends and family. With his strength, he know how to work physically demanding jobs with both strange (4 - 9 AM) and long hours (restaurants!). For all Andrew knew, there were also things he pretended he didn't know: how to make a bed or use a hamper, how to wash his car. He'd go weeks without bothering to deposit his pay. If you borrowed his car, you'd find his tip cash spilling out of his glove box and crumpled paychecks wedged amongst his CD's. He knew how to persist. In high school, he joined the football team. He went to every practice and practiced hard. He loved the sport, but despite the practice and training, he didn't get a lot of playing time. But he never quit. And so when he finally got into a game and scored a touchdown, his smile that day broke a record for joy. Andrew would always work hard. And he could play hard. Unfortunately for Andrew, playing hard lead to a struggle to stay sober. He faced that struggle head on. He went to treatment, he fought for sobriety. He knew that he had much to look forward to; he was building a great and generous life. But he lost his fight on April 7, 2018 at the age of 23. And so we lost a man whom we loved, a man who knew so much about making the world better for all those blessed to know him.

"drake opens up about the entire kanye/pusha t beef on lebron's ""the shop""",8434,9nq9qu,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 9nq9qu drake_opens_up_about_the_entire_kanyepusha_t_beef ,3339,1539396341.0,"\-Says Kanye texted him about coming to Wyoming

\-40 goes to Wyoming 1 day earlier than Drake and tells Drake that somethings “off”

\-Drake goes anyways and is told Ye wants to help Drake with music

\-Drake claims all his time in Wyoming was spent on helping Kanye

\-Drake says Ye asked for his release date for Scorpion and told Drake not to worry because he planned on dropping in November. Drake then woke up one morning to find that Kanye announced release dates for his albums based around Scorpion's June 15th release date (Which probably forced Drake to push Scorpion back 2 weeks.)

\-Drake says he played March 14th for Ye in Wyoming and showed him a picture of his son, and asked advice on how to handle the situation

\-Drake says Kanye played him Lift Yourself and gave him the beat. He left Wyoming with Lift Yourself and thinking everything was buddy buddy with him and Kanye

\-Kanye passively texts Drake  “I love you bro” and drops Lift Yourself himself with a bunch of scoops and Drake realizes Ye was trolling him and being manipulative the whole time and Drake started to distance himself

\- Says he was confused when Daytona dropped with ghostwriting disses against him and that Kanye helped produce it considering that he was just with them in Wyoming writing for them and helping them create music as friends

\-Says that only part of TSOA that was off limits was the 40 diss

\-He says the diss track he was creating was very bad and he was saying terrible things on it and didn't want to be remembered for that. He texted LeBron about ultimately not putting it out

\- He says he thought TSOA was trash but a genius chess move and that Push is gonna get whats coming to him eventually

\- Says he can live with ""rap purists"" thinking he has a ""chink in his armor"" for not responding. Says he'd much rather that then the lengths he was gonna go to on a diss against both Pusha and Kanye.

\- Says he made Nonstop, In My Feelings, Mob Ties and a bunch of other songs after the beef.

His main goal was to be front row for his favorite musical artist Kendrick Lamar.

A little about my brother. We grew up in a good family.l We had trouble in school. My brother and me were bullied. I was more open with my emotions. He was not. He hid his true emotions because he felt like admitting he was depressed was giving up. 

He went to the festival to see Kendrick. It turned crazy. When Kendrick performed the depression ballad 'U' he noticed my brother in the front row singing every word along with him. In the middle of his song he just stopped and demanded he joined him on stage.

2 days prior to this concert my brother had submitted an 1000 word essay for his college english class about this song. It was crazy.

Logan had no clue what to do and thought that he was asking for someone else. A few friends he made at the concert helped push him over the barrier. He got on stage and Kendrick broke into a speech about how depression is real. And how he may not understand what my brother is going through, but that he doesn't have to. He said people like my brother are why he makes songs. 

He had the crowd chant my brothers name. Then he allowed my brother to dance with him on stage while 30,000 people watched and cheered him on. He got to watch the rest of the concert from the side of the stage and walk with his IDOL to his car before he left.

I woke up the next morning seeing it all over twitter. I saw videos and all these crazy things. When he got off of the stage and was walking to his campsite he was stopped by over 100 people saying how awesome that was.

My brother can say what he wants but I know the true pain and stuff he's went through. 

Since the concert and this everythings changed. He is serious about losing his weight. He found a great girlfriend. He's taking school seriously. This has 100 percent been for the best of my brother and I'm so thankful he got the chance to join his idol on stage.

"kim kardashian interview: taylor approved the famous line and pretended she'd let the media in on the joke at the grammys. rick rubin, kim and other industry people were listening to kanye's phone call. there's video proof of the phone call because kanye records all his calls.

> Kim says Taylor's deep emotional wound is nonsense—okay, she says it's a lie—and that there's video proof, because a videographer was actually filming their phone call. Why? Because Kim's husband commissions videographers to film everything when he's recording an album, for posterity (and possibly, one day, a documentary). And this is where it gets sticky.

>**""She totally approved that,"" Kim says, shaking her head in annoyance. ""She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't. I swear, my husband gets so much shit for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.""** Kim is on a roll now, speaking faster and more animatedly than at any other point during our time together. **""What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?""**

>Swift, Kim insists,** ""totally gave the okay. **Rick Rubin was there. So many respected people in the music business heard that [conversation] and knew**. I mean, he's called me a bitch in his songs. That's just, like, what they say. I never once think, [gasping] 'What a derogatory word! How dare he?'Not in a million years.**

>**I don't know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden.… It was funny because [on the call with Kanye, Taylor] said, 'When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I'm so against this, and I'll just laugh and say, 'The joke's on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.' And I'm like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.""**

>Were they in touch after that?

>“No. Maybe **an attorney's letter she sent saying, ‘Don't ever let that footage come out of me saying that. Destroy it.’ ”**

>[Taylor] sent one?

>“Yeah. **They sent an attorney's letter like, ‘Don't you dare do anything with that footage,’ and asking us to destroy it.” She pauses. “When you shoot something, you don't stop every two seconds and be like, ‘Oh wait, we're shooting this for my documentary.’ You just film everything, and whatever makes the edit, then you see, then you send out releases. It's like what we do for our show.”**

e3: New Developments

* Taylor Swift's attorneys have sent a letter to the Kardashians threatening legal action if they release the footage. 

* California's a 2 party consent state meaning it's illegal to record someone on a call without their permission. These laws not only expose you to the risk of criminal prosecution, but also potentially give an injured party a civil claim for money damages against you.


* So if the recording gets leaked/released without Taylor's permission Kanye can face criminal charges by the state and Taylor can personally sue him which she has already threatened to do.

* If Taylor has nothing to hide, she would give consent to release the tape. She's obviously trying to hide the truth and California law lets her. 

* Taylor also had a very staged paparazzi shoot pretending to date Loki yesterday that dominated all the tabloids. Working theory is that her team is trying to divert all press attention away from the Kim K story. ",2016-06-16 13:28:45,1

i sent goldlink this tee back in february for free because i really fw him and his music. i [didn’t ask](https://i.imgur.com/qKgdwJq.png) for pictures, shoutouts, rt’s. nor did i want any. i simply sent it to him because it’d be cool knowing people i respected owned my clothing.

a few months later, now, i find out that it is being resold for his merch. i understand it is just 1 of 1 but i believe the principle is still there. i wouldn’t have even cared if he didn’t wear it, threw it away, or even gave it to someone, but the fact that he took a shirt i sent him for free and resold it as his merch without my permission nor any recognition bothers me.

some of my friends tried contacting the actual designers working under goldlink who “made” these shirts, heres some of their responses.

my main concern is that there are other brands who are also being recycled and sold. luckily my tee was posted on the gallery and i was able to see it, but who knows how many other brands are being used without them knowing.

at the end of the day i’m a really small brand and i’m just trying to make it out there. i as well as many other startup brands put lots of work into our designs, so seeing someone making it on hypebeast because they used my design is discouraging.",2017-09-30 10:38:34,1

**Album Background**

I was 16 when I first heard about Mac Miller.  Walking down the hallway in between classes at my old high school, I noticed a pile of flyers laying on the floor promoting a gig for someone who was, at that place and time, just a local rapper one year older than myself, trying to make it big in a city that was, up until Wiz’s ascent, not known for rappers or hip hop music of any sort.  I couldn’t have predicted that the kid I saw on the ad, performing in a small venue that likely didn’t seat more than a couple hundred people, would have the first independently released Billboard #1 in nearly two decades by the end of the following year.  I couldn’t have predicted that he would be making music with some of the biggest names in the industry not long after that.  I couldn’t have predicted that I would meet Mr. Miller myself on a couple occasions and, especially considering his earlier material pre-*Watching Movies with the Sound Off* hadn’t wowed me, that his later music would someday resonate with me in a way that not too many other artists’ music would.

&nbsp;

I also couldn’t have predicted that eight years later I would be legitimately shaken by his passing, more so than any other musician or public figure who had left this Earth earlier than expected in my lifetime.

&nbsp;

The tumultuous final months of Mac’s life were well-documented, as his break-up with Ariana Grande and subsequent drunk driving incident came within a week of one another in mid-May.  It was at this point that I, along with plenty of others, became genuinely concerned for where Mac’s headspace was at.  The drunken joyride was only part of the problem, as Grande confirmed that Mac’s inability to remain sober was what ultimately led to their estrangement.  Her short-lived engagement to SNL star Pete Davidson one month after couldn’t have made matters any better.  With the walls of Mac’s life seemingly crashing down around him, it only seemed inevitable that his next project would be used to address these controversies.

&nbsp;

Mac released three singles at the end of May following his car crash, only one of which made the album (a shame in a way, as I’d really enjoyed “Programs” and “Buttons” and feel the record would have benefitted from their inclusion, either in addition to the songs included on the final project or as replacements for one or two of the album cuts).  The album was officially announced in mid-July alongside the music video for lead single “Self Care”, and officially dropped on a jam-packed August 3rd which coincided with the releases of Travis’s *Astroworld*, YG’s *Stay Dangerous* and of course, the project that would end up overshadowing them all, Iggy Azalea’s EP that I can’t remember the name of.  As a result, *Swimming* may not have gotten the initial shine it deserved, but this was unfortunately rectified with Mac’s passing five weeks after its release, which propelled the album back onto the charts and prompted “Self Care” to become his first top 40 single.

&nbsp;

*Swimming* was crafted with a lineup of all-star producers and collaborators, including the likes of J. Cole, Snoop Dogg, Flying Lotus, Thundercat, John Mayer, DJ Dahi, Cardo, Dâm-Funk, Steve Lacy from the Internet and Dev Hynes of Blood Orange, just to name a few.  Mac’s producer pseudonym Larry Fisherman is also credited on several cuts, and film composer Jon Brion (most famous in Mac’s chosen genre for providing additional instrumentation on Kanye’s *Late Registration* and Frank Ocean’s *Blonde*) was brought in at the last minute to flesh out the production.  The album goes in many different directions and almost works as a summary of all the different styles of music Mac had approached making over the years - perhaps fitting for what would end up being his final piece of work.

&nbsp;

________________________________________
**Review**

Mac starts the proceedings with “Come Back to Earth”, a gorgeous guitar and keyboard-laden ballad which perfectly encapsulates a lot of the themes that permeate the rest of the music to follow: past regrets, social alienation and a pervasive sense of depression.  Mac’s singing chops aren’t always perfect on this album but on this cut in particular they’re wonderful: there’s a dual sense of melancholy but also hope that comes across in his performance, and while the track serves as not much more than an introduction (Mac’s performance lasts just over 2 minutes) it’s so powerful that I wound up enjoying this song perhaps more than anything else on the record.  This isn’t a slight against the rest of the album, though; more so it’s a testament to how impactful Mac’s message comes through along with his vocal, particularly the lyric “I’ll do anything for a way out of my head”, which, along with the rest of the album at large, has taken on a whole new significance now knowing he was doomed to find the way out sooner than he or anyone else expected.  

&nbsp;

Contrasting with the calmness of “Come Back to Earth”, “Hurt Feelings” picks the energy up with a brooding trap instrumental produced by Hollywood Cole himself, with Dev Hynes and Jon Brion contributing to the beat as well. Mac’s lyrics are equally celebratory and disturbing here: he alludes to the various worldly pleasures his success has brought him, referencing new cribs with blue fountains and his infamous jacuzzi video, but at the same time recognizes that his success hasn’t actually helped to solve his problems; in turn, it’s merely exacerbated them.  This is a pretty solid kick off to the record and helps to pick up the pace vibe-wise after “Come Back to Earth”.

&nbsp;

The album’s second single “What’s the Use?” comes next, an upbeat funk number for Mac to vibe over courtesy of Pomo and Dâm-Funk that falls in line stylistically with what Mac was doing on his previous album *The Divine Feminine*.  The production on the track is the easy highlight: it’s infectious and will get stuck in your head for days, with an indelible bass line and backing vocals from Snoop, Thundercat and Syd from the Internet helping to flesh everything out.  The musical high point for me has to be the synth cacophony complementing a soaring vocal that interrupts the proceedings in the middle of the track before launching back into the chorus.  Unfortunately, though, there is one semi-glaring flaw here that I cannot get past completely, and that’s Mac’s singing.  The chorus on “What’s the Use?” serves as the most obvious example on the record where his singing voice just doesn’t connect with me.  His raspy vocal doesn’t compliment the smoothness of the instrumental very well and, considering the hook is a major element of the track, does bring the song down a degree for me as a result.

&nbsp;

Things pick back up again in a major way on “Perfecto”, a song which finds Mac torn between his hedonistic tendencies and the true sources of happiness in his life (primarily Grande) that are trying to save him from drowning in the former.  My own interpretation of this song is that it finds Mac in between his breakup with Ariana and the eventual release of the album, as he references being “on album time” and presumably holing up in the studio (“I gotta get out to shine”).  He seems on the verge of regressing to the drugged-out lows of his yesterdays, referencing it “feeling like a weekend on a Tuesday” and making excuses to dip out on prior commitments to drink with his friends.  At the same time, he keeps up the appearance of being in a good place mentally (“On the surface I look so fine, but really I’m buggin’”) even while he’s treading water and unphased by the potential for him to drown.  Tee-WaTT's instrumental is smooth as silk and fits the vibe of Mac’s delivery and lyrics like a glove.  For me, though, the best part is Jon Brion’s orchestral outro, where Mac delivers a few lines spoken-word style about Ariana and peters out with one last “perfect”.  This song succeeds at pretty much everything it does.

&nbsp;

Following is the aforementioned “Self Care”, the most engaging track on the record and an easy highlight.  The near 6 minute epic is divided into two halves.  The first half has a much darker, more sadistic vibe to it, yet it manages to be catchy as hell at the same time (it’s easy to see why this ended up being the big single off the project).  I’d always taken Mac’s allusion to “self care” in the first half to refer to him self-medicating through drugs and alcohol as opposed to seeking professional help for his issues, and something tells me that “the medicine … on call” that he refers to in the first verse probably wasn’t prescribed by a doctor.  Mac’s paranoia is evident through this part of the song, with allusions to losing his mind and not being able to trust anybody (himself included).  The most relevant line has to be the one about Mac speeding in his Mercedes, but ironically enough, “Self Care” was actually written *prior* to his infamous car accident in an eerie instance of art imitating life.  All of this builds up into the grandiose second half, which features an *excellent* beat switch and a rejuvenated Mac reflecting on where he is in his life and how he’s been handling his substance abuse.  I’d initially suspected this part of the song had him recognizing the faults of his actions because of one line I’d apparently misheard: “I was doing too much, got stuck in oblivion”.  However, every lyric site I’ve checked has it written as “I was **thinking** too much”, which has me wondering if Mac is instead embracing his use in the end and not letting the thoughts surrounding it bother him any longer.  This is substantiated through further references to the oblivion being “a beautiful feeling” and the unfortunate assertion of having “all the time in the world” (it even hurts just having to type that out knowing what we now know in hindsight…)  All that said, this song just straight up *rocks*.

&nbsp;

“Self Care” leads right into “Wings”, which, in contrast to “Self Care”, has a decidedly calmer tone to it.  Alexander Spit’s instrumental feels pretty odd for a hip hop song: slow and fairly minimal, but it has a lot of different sounds and other effects popping up and exiting as Mac does his thing over top of it.  Mac covers a lot of different topics lyrically on here, but all in all feels like he’s in a better place than some of the other tracks on here, saying he “ain’t feelin’ broken no more” and that he “never felt so damn good where he’s at” (this might have had something to do with him recording the song in Hawaii – he even references the sun shining during the pre-chorus).  Not all is cheery in the second verse, though, where Mac acknowledges that he “doesn’t know how the normal shit go” with life given his celebrity status.  Mac’s singing up until the “These are my wings” refrain is pretty on point, but I’ve never really cared for the hook, honestly (though it isn’t as damning as “What’s the Use”, for what it’s worth).  All in all, this is a pretty smooth cut, though I wouldn’t consider it a highlight personally.

&nbsp;

“Ladders” picks the tone back up nicely and is a much better go at the funk sound Mac tried out on “What’s the Use”.  Pomo and Jon Brion lace this thing with an infectious groove, some seriously funky synth work and an awesome horn section following Mac’s hook.  Mac sounds like he’s having a blast here: the chorus (one of the best on the record) insinuates he’s likely in the middle of a night out (and probably high) and wants to make the most of this moment.  While the song’s got a primarily positive tone to it, like most of the more upbeat tracks on the album, there’s still something sinister lurking underneath, with Mac referencing how he “just might slip into the sea”, continuing with the swimming theme of the record.  Still though, this sits firmly as the best party number on the record, and it’s not surprising to see why this wound up being one of the most popular songs off the album.

&nbsp;

The introspective “Small Worlds” comes next and seems to represent the hangover after the high of “Ladders”.  The two songs seem connected, as one line on “Ladders” had Mac saying that “it’s a very small world, we don’t fuck with the size”, while another mentioned “turning the hotel to a castle” (a possible reference to cocaine).  On “Small Worlds”, the world is no longer small to Mac, as he’s left alone to ruminate on his feelings in the five star hotel.  The musical backing on the song, courtesy of Tae Beast and Carter Lang with John Mayer providing some additional guitar work, has a stoned and hazy feel to it, which is *exactly* my type of production style, so this was a real treat (and also sample free, which is surprising – the vintage feel of the instrumental had me swearing he must’ve looped it from somewhere).  It’s almost reminiscent of something Mac would have rapped over on one of his druggier mixtapes back in the day.  Mac’s flow on this joint isn’t anything flashy but it’s *just* right for this beat: ambivalent and a bit lackadaisical, but also perfectly fitting for the lyrical content.  For as great as the actual song is, though, the most moving moment is probably the outro, where Mac’s flow takes a more serious turn as he references “feeling his fingers slippin’” and anticipating his demise while dwelling on how fame isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be.  I really can’t praise this song enough.  

&nbsp;

“Conversation Pt. 1” sees Mac talking to someone who lives a “basic” life, spending all their time getting faded and wasting whatever money they manage to come across.  It’s hard to tell whether Mac is speaking to the listener, to himself, or someone else.  I did find it interesting that he says, “My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement”, which is the exact opposite of a line he’d delivered on “Perfecto” (“My feet on the clouds, head on the ground”).  It make sense, as on “Perfecto” Mac seemed more on the fence (or possibly in denial) about where his life was at at the moment, but on “Conversation Pt. 1” he feels supremely confident in himself (whether or not that’s the result of whatever got his ‘head up in the clouds’ is up to interpretation).  Cardo and Yung Exclusive’s work behind the boards here is decent, if not a bit forgettable (which came as a surprise to me as Cardo is one of my favorite producers).  Flying Lotus also has a production credit – I’m guessing he helped with the muted horn parts at the end.  This wasn’t bad but didn’t really feel all that exciting for me.

&nbsp;

Mac delivers the most obviously Grande-inspired cut on the album next with “Dunno”.  While this song was never explicitly confirmed to be about her, a few of the lyrics do seem to reference songs of hers (most notably the last line of the song, “That’s really your favorite, I know”, which supposedly references Mac & Ariana’s 2016 collaboration “My Favorite Part”).  Grande also shared a screenshot of her listening to “Dunno” after Mac’s death on her Instagram story, which seemingly confirms it to be true.  Admittedly, this song was never really a favorite of mine on here, as Parson Brown’s production work feels a bit stale and Mac’s singing is rough at times, but as a peek into Mac’s psyche as he reminisces on the good times he’d had with his girl, it’s pretty touching.

&nbsp;

“Jet Fuel” follows with a laid back beat courtesy of DJ Dahi and Steve Lacy that Mac is able to ride and talk his shit on.  The hook brings back a common theme from throughout the record of being up in the clouds, with Mac stating that he’ll only come down after running out of jet fuel before quipping, “But I never run out of jet fuel”.  I took this to be a commentary on the endless supply of drugs someone like Mac can afford, being rich as fuck and all.  There’s another reference to swimming and drowning at the start of the track as well, with Mac stating “his head’s underwater but he ain’t in the shower and he ain’t gettin’ baptized”.  Outside of these two lamentations, the track mostly consists of brags ‘n’ bullshit, with Mac flowing over the beat pretty effortlessly.  This one didn’t really wow me until the last minute, where the instrumentation drops out in favor of a single warbling synth line and a vocoder-aided vocal performance from Mac that honestly sounds like *nothing* I’ve ever heard him do before.  It’s a great display of his artistic side and showcases a style I wouldn’t have minded seeing him explore in the future.

&nbsp;

Up to this point, the album felt like it had been starting to take a dip in quality in the 2nd half, but fortunately Mac saved two of the best songs he had for very last.  “2009” sports a *beautiful* string-laden intro courtesy of Mr. Brion before transitioning into a mid-paced Eric G production built on a delicate piano loop.  Mac uses the nostalgic sounding instrumental to reflect on where life has taken him over the past decade, stating that “It ain’t 2009 no more”, referring to the last year he had before he really started to blow up (ironically enough, it was 2010 when I first discovered Mac in the hallway of my high school).  Mac doesn’t seem completely content with this passage of time on “2009”, but the song is ultimately an optimistic one, with Mac stating, “I don’t have it all but that’s alright with me”, though a few lines later he does ponder how his life might have been different had he “taken a simpler route”.  In spite of the mistakes he’s made, Mac seems at peace with himself here.  A really beautiful song all around, and one that’s highly relatable for me personally as, like Mac, it really does blow my mind to think 2009 was almost 10 years ago now…

&nbsp;

…which brings us to “So It Goes”, the last song Mac Miller would ever officially release.  It seems fitting that it would be a Larry Fisherman production.  Mac’s instrumental starts with a sole guitar strumming and tapping for percussion as he dwells on his ascendency to fame (“You could have the world in the palm of your hands, you still might drop it”), harkening back to simpler times as he had on “2009” (“There was nothin’ in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin’”), and delivering some premonitions that are especially disturbing in hindsight (“Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I'm still gettin' high”).  The instrumental continues to build on itself as the track progresses, until the last two minutes, where Mac breaks into the final chorus and Jon Brion returns with a *huge* swell of synthesizers that play Mac out in the most wonderful way possible.  In a sad twist, [Mac’s final tweet before his death] (https://images.genius.com/6d3940b0f0921f65dd031c9cb6bc54cd.563x1000x1.jpg) expressed his appreciation for the way the song’s outro was executed.  In the end, the man’s final publicized thought was concerned with the final part of his final song.  And just like that, *Swimming* comes to a close.

&nbsp;

________________________________________
I wrote the Album Background section of this review shortly after Mac’s passing when I was still in a complete state of shock over him not being around anymore and in a pretty emotional state (which is usually rare for me).  I was playing the album a *lot* at the time and reflecting on just how much context can come into play in music.  First hearing this record at the beginning of August, it felt like a proper transition point for Mac: sure, the drug references were abound and plentiful, but the album had just as many moments of clarity, and it really did feel like Mac *had* gotten to the point of being able to swim against the tide of his life.  Only a month later did we come to learn this wasn’t to be the case, though.  Now, the album stands as a memorial for one of hip hop’s most tragic stories, not unlike the memorial at Blue Slide Park that I’ve stood in front of in disbelief, reading through notes and letters from fans and old friends and just appreciating how much of an impact the man had left on the world in the incredibly short span of time that he was here.

&nbsp;


*Swimming* isn’t a perfect album.  I wouldn’t even peg it as the man's best album (though it’d probably end up in my top 3 Mac projects at the end of the day).  But as an insight into the final months of one of the biggest voices in this decade of hip hop, it’s a pretty compelling piece of work.  In spite of Mac’s death, this record is just so full of life that when you put it on, it almost helps you forget that he’s gone for a little while.  It isn’t his sharpest lyrically or his most consistent production-wise, but the *feel* of this record is what keeps me coming back to it more than maybe any other Mac project has.  You can tell from the interviews and live performances surrounding this record that Mac was really satisfied with what he’d been able to pull off here.  It makes the circumstances surrounding the album all that much harder to bear, but at the same time, it all comes back to the overarching theme: Mac Miller was drowning on Earth, but now he’s swimming somewhere else, and even if it’s wishful thinking on my part, I’d like to think that wherever he is now, he’s finally found peace.

**Discussion Questions**

•	Do you feel like Mac’s death changed this album for you from your initial perception of it? How so?

•	Where do you think Mac’s music would have gone from here?  There are so many different flavors he tried out on this thing that it makes me wonder how he would have followed it up

•	Would you want to see any posthumous material released from Mac?  For myself, the idea of an artist’s unreleased work coming out without them having a say in it has never sat right with me, but then again, I’m still hoping we might get to hear Pink Slime someday…

[Bunch of people on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/296141627532457??ti=ia ) had an idea to stream ""Hey Mama"" a lot and get it to chart.

>If anyone wants to join in please note that Spotify doesn’t count repeated consecutive plays, so the  playlist alternates between Hey Mama and Silver Surfer Intermission. You also need to have at least one bar of volume on Spotify for it to count.

>Edit: also if you REALLY want to contribute or you don’t wanna stream but still want to help you can also buy the song on iTunes and/or other platforms **once it’s the 10th in your timezone.** Streaming, however, has already started. 

>If you wanna mega-contribute you can buy the song on iTunes, google play, etc. and stream the song (using the playlists to meet the services’ metrics) on Spotify and Apple Music (and whatever other services count idk) simultaneously (might take a computer)",2017-11-09 11:12:58,1

EDIT: To add insult to injury, Lil B's set replaced Ski Mask. So neither of the sets that were supposed to happen at that time didn't. The crowd was chanting ""Fuck Boogie"" after Based God walked off

• could potentially denote a feature (props to /u/TheInfinityGauntlet for picking this up)

Note: The dot could also mean he's planning on releasing one of the tracks as a single since it says ""WHICH ONE?"" at the top of the page. Could it also mean he is planning on cutting one of them? We'll find out soon anyway

There is also a possibility the ""WHICH ONE?"" means ""which Pablo?"" (Picasso, Escobar, the one from Backyard Baseball, etc.)

Yasiin showed up after performing elsewhere in Denver with Talib Kweli the same night.

For anyone curious about  the show itself, it had some of the best vibes i’ve experienced at a show - basically a giant 
smoke session with Madlib and Yasiin Bey, freestyling beats and some casual rhymes.

That was wild. I understand why they chose to handle this situation this way, but at the same time I would really appreciate if they would just give people an update about what’s going on.

>*ICE spokesman Bryan Cox: “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested unlawfully present United Kingdom national Sha Yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph AKA ‘21 Savage’ during a targeted operation with federal and local law enforcement partners early Sunday in metro Atlanta.”*

>*""Mr. Abraham-Joseph was taken into ICE custody as he is unlawfully present in the U.S. and also a convicted felon. Mr. Abraham-Joseph initially entered the U.S. legally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa”, Cox emailed*

>*Important new info on #21Savage arrest: am told it was NOT part of a SuperBowl -related ICE operation, that he was in car with [Young Nudy] who was subject of a local police bust @wsbtv*

>*The rapper’s attorney, Dina LaPolt, told Variety: “We are working diligently to get Mr. Abraham-Joseph out of detention while we work with authorities to clear up any misunderstanding. Mr. Abraham-Joseph is a role model to the young people in the country — especially in Atlanta, Georgia and is actively working in the community leading programs to help underprivileged youths in financial literacy.”*

>*BREAKING- @21savage was in the car with [Young Nudy] who was the target of a criminal arrest. 21 was taken into custody by law enforcement after they learned of his immigration status. “There is no misunderstanding. 21 Savage is a British National.”: Law Enforcement source*

>Akademicks: *Spoke to 21 savage team... this whole situation a big misunderstanding ... hope it gets cleared up quickly. There’s a logical explanation behind everything as well... but until then them U.K. jokes gonna fly.  When the real story comes out a lot will identify with it .*

**TL;DR:** ICE is claiming that he is a UK national and that he entered the US legally in 2005 (at the age of 12) and has overstayed his visa. [There were past reports that he's from Dominica, where ppl get UK citizenship](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8094198/tomi-lahren-21-savage-bank-account-video-reaction). He was arrested in an investigation into Young Nudy, for the same thing.

Reading this often feels like hearing somebody say ""yo I just heard about this cool new underground band, it's called the Beatles you should check it out"". 

Some notable quotes:

- About MMLP on the day it came out: ""This will be the biggest selling hip hop album of all time""
- In 1996: ""**What could Canadians possibly rap about? Degrassi High?**""
- About Nas: ""I heard his next album is supposed to be called ""Still Illmatic""... when's he gonna learn he ain't NEVER gonna reproduce that ish? whatever... At least he should call it 'Stillmatic'""
- ""When is Dre going to make a new album? It’s been 3 years.
I know many people aren’t a bit interested, but I am, I like his shit.
And also, I was checking around, and I haven’t heard anywhere that he isn’t writing his own texts, like I heard somewhere around here. How do you know it and how can you be sure?""
- About Illmatic: ""This is a good album. This is a great album. This is probably the best debut to come out of New York since Black Moon’s “Enta Da Stage.” BUT, this is not the classic everybody’s been calling…for sure, everyone will be hypin' this album and 12"" of the singles will get mad play. But a classic? A classic debut? Like “People’s Instinctive Travels…” or “3 Feet High and Rising?” Naw man. Like “Criminal Minded” or “Paid In Full?”
C'mon.""

Or some people were horribly wrong too:

- ""JA RULE = NEXT TUPAC""
- ""And also heard new shit from Snoop Dogg
Dont know the name of it but it went something like 'Rolling down the street, Smoking Endo, Sipping on Pils'""
- people in 1995 were saying Wu Tang were “commercial trash for suburban white kids"" HOW???
- Anticipating Biggie's *Ready To Die*: ""personally i think it wont live up to the hype and he will be forgotten""

You can find *Illmatic* reviews on the day it came out, threads announcing the death of Tupac - and people being dicks about it: “hahahaha who cares” and “shut up, he was still human.. show some respect!!!”. Also, people were racist af. 

Edit: Yes I know *Illmatic* is a classic, hence I could have put the quote at the 'horribly wrong'-section. However, he still thought it was a great album and by comparison I don't think there were *that* many people calling GKMC or TPAB a classic on the day it came out. Sooo, he wasn't correct, but also not ""horribly wrong"" - it takes time for albums to become a cemented classic for everyone. More like a 'notable quote'",2018-04-09 07:25:35,1

&#x200B;

Credit to  [u/JamRed10](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamRed10) and  [u/itsobs](https://www.reddit.com/user/itsobs) for making the first two guides, but they were missing quite a bit when capturing China as a whole.

&#x200B;

Hip-hop in China is just now becoming a big deal with the second season of The Rap of China having just ended (and is  accused of becoming maybe a little too mainstream), and can be divided into two categories :

* ""Western"" style features trap beats and Western style (Higher Brothers, Tizzy T, etc.). If these people spoke English they wouldn't sound that different from their American/Western counterparts, and often gain some traction outside of China.
* ""Chinese"" hip-hop, which is very under-appreciated outside of China, is a blast to the past far beyond the time of Tupac and Biggie. Talkin about two-thousand year blast to the past, with flutes and the classic Chinese up-and down style mixed with a hip-hop beat and flow that would make you think Confucius is coming back to life. Songs in this category often include many Chinese idioms and ancient references, which is a big part of why it is virtually unknown out of the country. They usually discuss not the stereotypical ""drugs and bitches"" but rather things discussed in poems from the times of Li Bai(who is often cited as inspiration for a lot of things in China) such as romantic heroes, homesick travellers, and how to compose oneself in society.

Some examples of the Chinese style :

[Gai - Self-control and Discipline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuqNddy1QbU)

[GAI ft Kungfu-Pen and AfterJourney - Tiger Mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlvjOVgQhus)

[Key.L - The Vigilante of the Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khHDcW1OSRU)

&#x200B;

Chinese rap is also divided into cities, as is Chinese culture as a whole to be honest. As such, groups tend to form exclusive to cities, with Chengdu and Chongqing becoming the two biggest ones (due to the dialects there being far superior to mandarin when it comes to the rhymes and flow needed for hip-hop to sound good). When looking at Chinese hiphop you will see ""CDC"" and ""CSC"" a lot, this is just ""ChengDu Cheng"" and ""ChangSha Cheng"" which simply means Chengdu City and Changsha City.

**From Chengdu :**

* The well known Higher Brothers group, including four people, MaSiWei, DZ Know, Melo, and Psy.P. They are the most well-known group outside of China. MaSiWei is an OG and has been around for quite a while before Higher Brothers, under the name OG Skippy.

[OG MaSiWei - Learning Taoist Principles](https://youtu.be/5y_sIQTYwHo)

* Ty. - the most successful outside of China (although not the most well-known). Raps about hard stuff that you don't usually hear in China, and even featured in a track in Crazy Rich Asians.

[Successful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVNMTs01swE)

[Mainlanders Supreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoyxh56_Bok) \- slightly controversial outside the mainland for light dissing Taiwanese, Japanese, Filipinos (the song literally goes under the premise ""20 years ago you all laughed at the People's Republic now you are all forced to fear us, all who want to get rich come to China)

[You Can't See Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOD8RuFHHxc)

* Fat Shady(Xie Di) - was somehow pretty popular with some decent stuff, however he got a lot of hate from making an over-the top xenophobic song discussing foreigners in China(literally called Fuck off Foreigners, which dropped his status quite a bit)

[Shady Has it All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pqS6Ou0RRQ)

[Fuck Foreigners....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWZ8yTQyqoA)

* The other various artists from Chengdu RapHouse (where the Higher Brothers are from)

1. AnsrJ - had one of the best Lil Pump disses

[Fuck Lil Pump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZbafOTRuSM)

2.  Wang Yitai/3HO - may not be the best rapper but he happens to have an amazing voice

[Don't Close Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKZMVhQC4X8)

&#x200B;

**The Chongqing rappers are the main rivals to the Chengdu artists :**

* The famous Gai, who co-won the first season of Rap of China and is somewhat credited with birthing the hip-hop revolution in China. He came straight from the streets from Chongqing and early in his career was known as ""Gangsta God Gai"". Keeps it real with a strong Chinese style and uses tons of Chinese references and idioms(Chengyu) to where his songs are often straight lyrical, like if Shakespeare came back from the dead as a Chinese person. On top of his rap skills, he has one of the BEST singing voices in China. The government dragged him off a very popular singing show because his voice was too good and they didn't want a former gangster breaking into real mainstream culture. Singlehandedly carries Chongqing hip-hop.

**The Xinjiang rappers are quickly making the Islamic province the capital of Chinese Hip-hop, with two Uyghur artists stealing the show in the latest season of The Rap of China. Just like their African-American counterparts, their minority struggle with a hostile government has pushed them into embracing an unknown musical style to show their struggle.**

* AfterJourney - The big boi of Xinjiang beloved by all, he has beef with no-one and raps about the struggle of day-to-day life and his pride to be embracing a musical style rejected by his culture. He recently had a burst of international fame when he went to Britain and worked with grime-rap artist Cadell.

[My Mother is the Giant in my Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wYpWHb0H5M)

* Nawukere/Lil-em, called the Eminem of China, due to him starting online doing Eminem covers. He easily raps with a speed that eclipses Eminem in Rap God and does so in three different languages, Mandarin, Uyghur, and English. Eminem is still considered far above him due to Eminem's lyrical meaning and writing ability, but Nawukere sure has the speed element of Em. He is also well known for his frequent use of Uyghur.

**The Changsha rappers are not really trying to gain international recognition, but rather make music they enjoy. This leads to their style encompassing pretty much the entirety of the hip-hop spectrum, depending on what they feel like doing.**

* The group C-Block is by far the most well known out of Changsha, featuring Kung-fu Pen, DamnShine, and Key.L. They have done all sorts of musical styles based on nothing but what they happen to feel like making, from jumpy '90s style that's kind of like Run-DMC but at the same time not, underground sounding tracks talking about the police and vigilante life that takes influence from NWA, to just the ancient Chinese sounding classics.

* Kung-fu Pen, while not the best artist out there, is an absolute performance god. Whenever he is onstage, he is always  is full of energy and can get a crowd maximum hype real quick. He has a pleasing deep voice and emits an aura that makes you want to like him.

[Li Sao (an ancient Chinese poem)](https://youtu.be/3rHibbBWR9U)

* Key-L is the singer of C-Block, but also raps incredibly well. He works by himself often unlike the other two, and strongly embraces the old Chinese style. He encompassed this in one of his lines ""They all say Key.L, you rap like an ancient man long dead / Well are you really dumb enough to have to pick up a book to understand my lyrics?"" He had from what I can tell a troubled past, and often raps with a very dark or angry tone because of it.

[Soldier of the Inevitable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrUq5ay020k)

[Dark Dreams ft SIO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoFOCnDiRUw)

* Damnshine doesn't tend to work alone, and considers himself to not be up to the levels of his comrades. He is nevertheless quite good and gained fame through his Higher Brothers diss where he even took shots at Masiwei vs Beibei. He got to perform with and meet Snoop Dogg.

* Sio/Dirty Xio used to be a part of C-Block and was seen frequently with them, but has since split and is now doing his own thing. He often sounds ""spooky"", like he will haunt you to your grave, and is often compared with 21 Savage for using his very deep voice to simply talk over a beat.

**Rap from Nanjing is pretty much just one guy**

* Jony J - has been around for a long time and has never been super famous but always good, had quite a funny moment when he was eliminated from Rap of China for forgetting the lyrics to his own song.

**Xi'an**

* This comprises the infamous HongHuaHui group, who is well known for their more ""defiant"" lyrics. They've been heavily censored due to this. The two most famous in the group I would say are PG One and BeiBei(who famously demolished Masiwei in the 8-mile).

[PG One - Zhong Er Bing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKz50IxsPjI)

[Bei Bei - So Fresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zim6gCuEC6M)

* Pact(Pa-ke-te) has only just recently gained fame, and always seems kind of bored, but this results in his style being really chill and easy to vibe to.

**Taiwanese rap has been around far longer than it has on the mainland, and includes some really good stuff. The ancient Chinese style is sadly absent from the music there. Whether or not you consider Taiwan to be connected to mainland China, the rap game most certainly is, and artists across the strait will frequently collaborate.**

* MC Hotdog (and Chang Chen-yue) are an incredible duo with some great stuff. Hotdog's been in it for a looong time. I'm going to be honest, I thought they were black people speaking Chinese when I first saw them because they do look like it(lol).

[MC is Coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLR5Rls8iWM)

[MC Hotdog and Chang Chen-yue ft Kungfu Pen and PACT - Goodbye Hiphop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TJrheSXuPc)

There's quite a lot from Taiwan, enough to make another post like this, so I will just leave you with Hotdog, and if you're interested, find some more by looking into it.

**Guangdong**

* Chillgun, pretty chill. Good music with some Cantonese thrown in.

[You're Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccMx9ABbZbU)

* Tizzy T, used to work with Chillgun but they had a falling out.

[Ya Boi Tizzy T ft MC Hotdog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuMNOsPLxqk)

**Tibetan Rap is quite young, and often talks about the Tibetan lifestyle in the wild terrain, far from the problems of the cities.**

* Uncle Buddhist,  he was born in the pasture area but grew up in the city and thus he’s confronted with sharp contact between the Tibetan tradition and modern life. He released the first ever Tibetan hiphop album, making him the OG of Tibetan rap. (even though it came out less than a year ago lol)

>We're told she told cops that Chris raped her in his hotel suite dressing room for somewhere between 25 and 30 minutes. She says she then went into another room and was raped again, this time by one of Brown's friends.
> And then, she said she was ""abused"" for a third time in another room. We're told police believe the story doesn't hold water because she never attempted to leave or alert anyone of the 20 or so people who were in the living room.

i wish rappers would stop glorifying xanax,5972,4ezs44,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 4ezs44 i_wish_rappers_would_stop_glorifying_xanax ,1271,1460768657.0,"Sorry if this breaks any rules but this shit really upsets me. I was in the car today, listening to *Moses* by French Montana, Chris Brown and Migos. It's got a great beat, catchy hook, etc... but Chris Brown's line really stuck out to me. 

""Pineapple Fanta it mix with the xanax, she lovin' the codeine""

Fuck, man. This is on the radio, uncensored. My 11 year old bro is in the car with me hearing this shit. I wish rappers would be a little more responsible when mentioning a drug like xanax, it makes codeine look like nothing. Both are bad habits on their own, but rapping about mixing them like that? 

Yams just died of this exact combo. ~~Xanax is a worse habit than heroin.~~ Xanax *withdrawal* is worse than heroin *withdrawal*. You'll spend months completely barred out, living in a lethargic stupor. It robs you of your soul. It's impossible for others to talk to you, because you forget the conversation you're having and re-start it a thousand times.

Of course it's not a rapper's responsibility to censor themselves for the sake of the children. I""m curious to see how the widespread use of xanax affects the culture of hip hop a few years from now when the tolls of this addiction sets in for those who are abusing it regularly. But it's completely fucked when 14 year olds are taking bars before school because that's the cool, new drug around. Hopefully it's just a phase like how ""molly"" was really big in rap for a while.

Thoughts?

**Edit: Let me clarify that I am not advocating artistic censorship. I do however believe that the radio stations should not allow the name brand of drugs to be mentioned on their airwaves. Why is ""he gotta eat the booty like groceries"" censored but ""mix xanax with lean"" isn't?**

**Edit 2: This has turned out to be a very productive discussion. Thank you all who have kept it civil and enlightening. For those of you who have blown up my DM's calling me a ""pussy ass faggot"" and ""bitch ass cracka,"" I don't really appreciate it but thanks for your input anyway**

charlemagne confesses to drugging a woman in 2015 podcast,5727,8yeok2,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 8yeok2 charlemagne_confesses_to_drugging_a_woman_in_2015 ,1140,1531436819.0,"[**Audio**](https://youtu.be/zVjEKi9le-0?t=1610). I thought it'd be good to share this in light of the  rape accusation.

**Here's a transcript of the important part:**

Charlamagne: Listen man, you just never know... Its a lot of gray areas when it comes to that shit man... a lot of gray area. 

Andrew: yes there are gray areas but if you're unconscious you rape somebody, and thats plain and simple, and theres nothing you can do around that, if you're unconscious...even if she's drinking, even if she's tired b she ran a marathon that day... if she passes out and she's unconscious now and you fuck her, that's rape... Now, this is a weird thing that has been said to me by multiple girls actually, uh they go ""you know what'd be fun, is we woke up in the morning, and you were like already fucking me..."" I'm like, you mean raping you? WTF why you trying to get me caught up? Doesn't that sound like a set up? That's how I'm in jail for 10yrs because of some fantasy that you had. You never had a girl say that? Like how we just wake up... 

Charlamagne: I remember a scenario in Myrtle Beach, South Caroline, I got this girl real drunk, and uhm, I fucked, we fucked. 

Andrew: ... just that sentence sounds a little fishy, ""I got her drunk against her will..."" 

Charlamagne: Nah I did. Now I didn't just get her drunk I went to the sex store and got Spanish Fly. 

Andrew: Oh so you raped her? 

Charlamagne: Shut up. Spanish Fly. They sell it in the sex store, I'm telling the truth... they sell it in the Spanish store. I had the fucking... I mean they sell it in the sex store. 

Andrew: Why you snitching on you dog? They sell knives in the store too, you can put that to a girls throat, and have sex with her, doesn't mean its legal. 

Charlamagne: So I put the spanish fly in the E&J, we drinking the E&J and shit... so in my mind I don't know if this shit really work, but I feel like I got horny as a motherfucker too! Right? Right? 

Andrew: You took it too? 

Charlamagne: So she was drunk and shit, and we had sex and shit, and like a lot of my boys were trying to come in the room and fuck her and I'm like nah chill out, we not doing that, I'm not gonna let y'all run a train on her, that's rape. So, right, so, so... 

Andrew: If its just one on one, its ain't rape. Trains are rape. 

Charlamagne: So the next morning, the next morning she wakes up and uhm, we talk about it. And she's like ""What happened?"" I'm like ""We had sex."" she said ""Ok well I'm glad it was you."" Then a couple days later, she's like ""Yo are you sure I only had sex with you?"" Because one of my stupid ass cousins was going around saying he fucked her, which he didn't, I know for a fact he didn't. I was there with her the whole time. He did not fuck her. He looked at her naked, but he didn't fuck her. Right? So, so, so... I'm telling her no me and you just had sex, nobody else did nothing. So it just was weird that she was like, ""I'm just glad it was you."" You know what I'm saying, because in mind yea you could have been in a real bad situation if it was another motherfucker there... 

Andrew: That's a huge compliment man. A girl just said, ""yo at least you raped me."" 

Charlamagne: I didn't rape her. I did not rape her. I did not rape her. 

Andrew: If it was any of your cousins or friends... it would have been rape. 

Charlamagne: I didn't rape her, because me and her had every intention of having sex with each other. 

Andrew: So then why would you put the Spanish Fly? 

Charlamagne: I was a freaky... I'm still a freaky motherfucker but I was really, I was... listen I was... my whole... 

Andrew: Wait, was she passed out when you fucked her? 

Charlamagne: Nah... she wasn't like. She was like one of those drunks where listen, no listen, no, she was one of those drunks where like, she was like one of those drunks where she was like oh, coher... she wasn't coherent, but she was up, like when your girl... like when you're blacked up like that don't know what the fuck is going on type shit, like she was really fucked up... 

Andrew: She was awake and she was into it? 

Charlamagne: She was wasted. Yea. She was wasted. 

Andrew: Her eyes were not rolling in the back of her head? 

Charlamagne: Nah nah nah nah... she was 

Andrew: Ok was she snoring while you were having sex? 

Charlamagne: It was just weird because while we were having sex, she was... because one of my homeboys used to fuck her on the regular. When I say the regular, the regular... that was his girl. He hates me probably to this day. 

Andrew: Wait, so you fucked your friends girl? 

Charlamagne: I was a piece of shit. It wasn't his girl tho, it was like a girl he used to really love. So this is the whole story... The girl was white right, and he was black... so this is in Monks Corner, South Carolina... they couldn't really have an inter-racial relationship at the time, dixie flag flying over and shit, right, they couldn't be... it couldn't really go down. So they couldn't really claim each other, you know what I'm saying... but it was one of those weekends she just mad at the motherfucker, and came to get drunk with me, and I had been flirting with her, and we had been talking on the phone, we kiss every now and then. 

Andrew: This is your boy's girl... 

Charlamagne: This is my boy's... He should have claimed her. 

Andrew: Which boy? 

Charlamagne: I'm not saying.. 

Andrew: Do I know him? 

Charlamagne: Nah you don't know him. He should have claimed her. 

Andrew: Was he at your wedding? 

Charlamagne: Hell no. Absolutely not. But its like, we knew it was going to happen but it was just the fact that it could have been really bad for her, is my point. The fact that she woke up the next day and was like ""I'm just glad it was you, and just you."" was weird to me... that was a little strange. 

Andrew: I like the fact that you made yourself a hero in this story. 

Charlamagne: I did. I'm the Dr. Dre. I wrote... I wrote this... straight out of Monks corner. I wrote this. 

Andrew: Sweetheart they was trying to come in the room... they were trying, after I drugged you and you passed out... they were trying to come in and get some pussy but I said no. 

Charlamagne: I did not drug her, and pass out.... ",2018-07-12 18:06:59,1

discussion method man is the rap feature goat,5549,agow2d,reddit  r hiphopheads ments agow2d discussion_method_man_is_the_rap_feature_goat ,593,1547667843.0,"###**Method Man is the feature GOAT**

I’m gonna break down why Method Man has the greatest feature/guest discography. Now, I know he’s not the most prolific feature artist, rappers like Snoop Dogg & Lil Wayne have appeared on many times more tracks, but on the other hand, I think he still has more significant accolades and much more consistent high quality features. I’m gonna list various accolades, highlights and stand-out songs. 

**[Pac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gztDvPWTWs) & [Biggie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YepLtnH_7o) features**

Method Man & Bone Thugs N Harmony are the only artists to feature on both a Notorious B.I.G & Tupac album. Raekwon & Ghostface Killah had a minor feud with Biggie around the same time because they didn’t like him claiming the crown in N.Y or him using the mafioso persona they were rocking. Still, Method Man scored a feature, making the only rap appearance on ‘The What’ from Biggie’s debut album 'Ready To Die', and drops an iconic hook & two great verses, with people still arguing who came harder on the track. He then appeared on Pac’s All Eyez on Me in ‘96, along with Redman & Tha Dogg Pound on the song ‘Got My Mind Made Up’. While not as iconic of a track, it’s nothing short of a great posse cut on a classic album, with Meth arguably having the best verse. Ready To Die is since 6x Platinum and All Eyez On Me is Diamond certified. 

**[‘Onyx - The Worst’](https://youtu.be/0qFTcmUZY5Y?t=206) - Back And Forth with Sticky Fingaz**

To me this is the greatest & hardest back and forth bar trading verse ever. This ‘97 posse cut was on Onyx’s third album, Shut Em Down, and both Method Man & Sticky Fingaz were killing it left and right at the time, easily both qualifying as some of the best MCs active in New York with both consistently bodying tracks they appear on. Here they join forces, spitting just a few words to line or two before switching who’s rapping, with crazy charisma levels and great flows. Just listen to it. 

(Method Man in italics) 

>*Enough said, let's paint this whole fuckin’ town red*

>And RIP… Their whole crew to a shred!

>I got cold blood. *I pull yo’ plug*. I hold, bust!

>*Show no love*. I’m so bugged. *Shoot yo’ home up*

>And shoot up the whole club. *We throw slugs*

**Caribbean Collaborations**

Plenty of rappers have a one off reggae/dancehall song, or at a least Carribean themed one, or have incorporated Patois slang & accents, but it often just seems like lazy wave riding or clichéd. Method Man has appeared on songs of the sort and has definitely flirted with some Jamaican slang in his lyrics, but it has always struck me as more authentic rather than wave riding, not to mention they’ve been consistently dope. His first song of this sort was along with Reggae legend Capleton in ‘95, on the track [‘Wings Of The Morning’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckw8B-WZKco) that would better fit the genre label Ragga. The song samples Otis Redding’s famous piano loop on Hard To Handle, and the chemistry between the two artists makes for a really fun song. It’s also one example of how versatile Meth is, adapting seamlessly to Capleton’s sound. If you like this song, don’t miss the Def Jamaica song [Lyrical 44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbODz4RWqFQ) with Meth, Redman & Damien Marley.

**[‘D’Angelo - Left & Right’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT75hdcOOkU) & other Neo-soul and R&B crossovers**

D’Angelo’s album Voodoo is often cited as one of the greatest Neo-Soul albums ever, and to me Left & Right is one of the best songs from it, in addition to being one of the most popular from it. Although tag teaming with Redman, this is another example of Method Man appearing on the only track with a feature on absolutely classic albums, along with Ready To Die too. It speaks to the quality of Meth’s features when he’s on two arguably greatest albums of two separate genres, that additionally had no other songs with features. Anyway, the song is a ridiculously smooth party jam and both Red & Meth’s verses add a lot to it. Beyond this he's made some other crossover into R&B & Neo-soul territory, like with Mary J. Blige & Boyz II Men, to pretty good effect. 

**Modern relevance**

Method Man has been killing it this decade. He’s made songs with veteran rappers, for example in 2017 laying down a great verse on the Boot Camp Clik x Wu-Tang Clan posse cut [‘Clan & Cliks’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPtAeWM1S98) from Sean Price’s posthumous album, with a very slick reference to Sean Price’s first recorded verse ever on Smif-N-Wessun’s ‘Cession At The Doghille’, and another solid verse on Snoop’s Mt. Kushmore, among others. But on top of that, he’s appeared with plenty of newer artists to a great effect, like A$AP Nast’s [‘Trillmatic’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xda8NvdEfA), Ocean Wisdom’s ['Ting Dun'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV31ySeDtpU) (one of the best feature verses of 2018 easy, great shit), and most recently, [J.I.D’s DiCaprio 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTmwrCkGePg), and all of those songs are to me some of the best all of those artists have made so far, and it seems many agree based on discussion I've seen on here in addition to their numbers.   

**Made Limp Bizkit bearable**

For whatever reason, Method Man appeared three times on Limp Bizkit songs, and [one of them was even produced by DJ Premier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA__arRdQ6M). This other terrible, awful instrumental remix of [Rollin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAU9YqBYrz4) was also made featuring Method Man, Redman & DMX, who all come together to save the song from the beat and make it a pretty fun track because you got DMX in his prime spazzing and  everyone else still coming through well. I wouldn't call any of these songs great, but it's still a big feat. 

**The Wu-Tang solo project features**

I’m not sure if it counts as features, but I think they’re worth mentioning at least. On every classic first wave Wu-Tang solo album, Method Man has one of the best verses, on one of the best songs. On GZA’s Liquid Swords Meth is on [Shadowboxin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IZE7JSLJU0), where he steals the show and has a majority of the vocals on the track. He’s on ODB’s [‘Raw Hide’](https://youtu.be/bPxXe8LCvI8?t=150), one of the grimiest tracks from that album. [Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7OO2jjZbwU) from OB4CL, a classic 90s anthem that made it to 37 on billboard hot 100, in 1995. [Box In Hand](https://youtu.be/thZb56n0BWs?t=120) on Ironman, not the most popular cut from the album but it’s definitely a gem, with a catchy but still grimy beat and a great verse from Meth. Beyond these he’s still making great features with active Wu-Tang rappers to this day, for example [Czarface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vPbSBAaHDo) & [Masta Killa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrVHnBNFJqw). 

**‘Redman - [Do What U Feel’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynLKunoQHB8)**
 
Although Redman & Method Man would go on to form a duo, this was only their second collaboration on a song, after the hugely successful [How High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzR-8ItgZ9A) single from ‘95. Do What U Feel was on Redman’s third album, Muddy Waters, with a quite similar sound so Shadowboxin’, with a laid back, hazy beat with a funky bassline, and Method Man spitting the first and last verses. In my opinion this is the best collaboration these two have made, and surely raised more interest in the potential of a Meth & Red duo, rather than How High just having been a one off thing. 

**Method Man dunked on Shaq**

Not in the court though. If you weren’t aware, Shaq had a short lived rap career where he dropped four albums, taking a more serious approach to it than most athlete gone rapper attempts seen before. His second album, ‘Shaq Fu - Da Return’, [had a Meth & RZA feature on the first track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIh85dJpoWs), and Meth stomps the track, rapping circles around Shaq. It might be one of my favourite verses he’s done. Definitely a highlight from Shaq’s rap catalog.  


**In general / conclusion**

Beyond these specific cases and songs, Method Man has appeared on over 200 songs as a feature artist throughout his career, both poppy and underground, every decade since the 90's, from Missy Elliot to Heltah Skeltah to Proof to Boyz II Men to A$AP Mob, etc. In the mid 90s he was a star and he's retained a legendary status despite not being as popular anymore, but even at his commercial peaks he's always been able to dip back into his hardcore roots. I don’t really think he has a feature verse that’s under 7/10, but more often than not I'd rank them higher than that, and amazingly I don't think his quality has really decreased one bit with the years. Meth really has the ability to really turn a song into something great with his appearances. I’m also gonna link a bunch of songs (in addition to those linked in the text above) that feature him. Also shoutout Redman because he appears on like half of these tracks.

Of no relevance to Meth as a feature artist, but [Method Man & Ghostface Killah's freestyle on Stretch & Bobbito in '94 is amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I1PF0ojwwg) if you're fiending for more Method Man material.

Some points for discussion

- How big of a factor should commercial success be (if at all) for being the best in this category? Method Man's numbers aren't up there with a number of other rappers. 

- Method Man is generally acknowledged as a great rapper, and is one of the most popular members of the Wu-Tang Clan. That said, he's usually not included in top 10 conversations due to a lacking solo discography. Could an artist warrant a spot on such lists off features rather than solo work? 

- If not Method Man, then who? 

- Any other Method Man features you rate highly that were left off? 

- Am I wrong about Method Man having no bad feature verses? If so what comes to mind?",2019-01-16 13:44:03,1

We have resolved this issue amicably among all parties as adults. We were friends before this and will remain friends afterwards. Being raised by strong women who taught me to respect everyone, I’m disappointed in the situation as well as myself and will reflect on the situation appropriately.""

"as a woman who loves this sub and hip hop music, i really want to add my two-cents about the a$ap bari situation.",5185,6oamt4,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 6oamt4 as_a_woman_who_loves_this_sub_and_hip_hop_music_i ,938,1500490547.0,"I'm a huge lurker and I usually enjoy just reading others' opinions, but I know the demographics of this sub and most of you are teen/young adult men.   So I'm here to offer a woman's perspective on the Bari video. Reading some of the responses to threads about Bari and the video made me sick to my stomach. People are using the word rape and rapist, pinning such an allegation on him without knowing the facts--I agree this isn't right. But really y'all? You are going to get hung up on that and not focus on the fact that a naked crying woman was begging Bari to stop and leave her alone...but it wasn't rape...and that's the point, right? NO. How many more women need to go through this before we stand up and say ""hey! This person was severely abused and the hip hop community doesn't stand for it."" 

My next point is everyone was applauding Playboi Carti for basically saying I don't condone his actions, but that's my boy. I don't know about you, but if I saw a video of my friend treating a woman like that, that person isn't my friend. If you're okay with supporting someone with that kind of character (or lack thereof) I don't fuck with you. Simple. 

The hip hop community is so lax about the way women are treated that Chris Brown got away with beating the shit out of Rihanna, and was allowed to put out new music and features after that and was embraced with open arms. 

I'm pretty confident Bari will be just fine too. I just wish this sub and lovers of the music would acknowledge that hip hop doesn't love its women, and it's a big problem we all need to wake up to. 

And I'm not forgetting about the women that objectify themselves and allow it to happen, but in some circumstances, being naked in a music video is a way to survive just the way selling crack rocks on the street is for these dudes out here. Something to think about. 

Readying myself for the backlash. 

EDIT: okay so I consistently roll my eyes at cheesy edits but holy shit. Wasn't expecting such constructive and insightful comments. Very grateful for the chance to open up a dialogue about misogyny/violence towards women in hip hop. I hope the dialogue only continues and allows for change on some level. Keep the comments coming, love reading everyone different perspectives on this. 

EDIT 2: I used Chris Brown as an obvious and well known example. I'm not giving Kodak, xxxtentacion, Dr. Dre, or any other artist a free pass. They're all wrong for what they did and it should be known. Let's go big picture here lol just used Chris as an example. I removed Freddy Gibbs as he was found innocent on all charges.

EDIT 3: I just want to leave this post by saying my broader point was about violence against women and misogyny in the industry and society at large. Bari was just the most relevant example of both those things which is why he was the subject of this post. Sexism is a systemic issue that is broader than hip hop--it spans society as a whole. Just start asking yourself: why do we accept behavior that outright disrespects, belittles, and devalues women? How can we--men and women--do better as a whole? Have a little empathy and see things from another persons eyes, you can learn and grow a lot. Thanks r/hhh for letting me use this platform to generate an honest discussion. ",2017-07-19 13:55:47,1

http://www.liveradio.fr/radios/khht_923_fm_los_angeles_ca_usa_only

**EDIT: HE'S ABOUT THE PLAY THE FIRST CRUEL WINTER SINGLE**

SONG: CURRENTLY UNTITLED (FEATURING GUCCI MANE, TRAVIS SCOTT, DESIIGNER, BIG SEAN, QUAVO, 2 CHAINZ & YO GOTTI)


-------------

**WILL UPDATE AS INTERVIEW CONTINUES**

EDIT 2: IT STILL HASN'T HAPPENED BUT IT'S COMIN. Kanye currently talking about how he recycles old ideas for tracks for different projects. He said the chorus for his new single has been something he's had for a long while. ""I had the basic beat for a year and a half. It sounded right for this project"" 

EDIT 3: https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/738736692631330816

EDIT 4: Talking about how it's certain people's jobs to innovate, to push the boundaries. He says he constantly working on new music and creative energy that people need. **Says he asked Taylor Swift how she felt about the Famous line.**

EDIT 5: 
>""What would Kanye West call himself?""  -BB
         
> ""A human being, an innovator, a servant."" - KW


EDIT 6: Now playing 30 Hours...Now playing Classic Man

EDIT 7: HERE WE GO - NO TITLE, NEEDS TO BE MIXED A COUPLE MORE TIMES

EDIT 8: ITS HAPPENING

EDIT 9: **IT'S THE YE BUTTON**

EDIT 10: **FEATURING GUCCI MANE, LA FLAME/DESIIGNER HOOK, BIG SEAN, QUAVO,  2 CHAINZ, YO GOTTI - THE FEATURES NEVER END**

EDIT 11: KANYE WAS RIGHT, THAT WAS COLD AF - Today really has been a GOOD Friday.

EDIT 12: WE'RE BACK!! He's talking about his relationship with Desiigner. Loves his energy and creativity - says he's about to drop something incredible. 

EDIT 13: **SAYS PANDA WILL HAVE A 15 MINUTE REMIX WITH EVERY GOOD MUSIC SIGNEE**

EDIT 14: TLOP process was an emotional rollercoaster. Said being married was an influence on his writers block, but then used it as a topic of his rap - compared to Em's inability to say the N word, he had to think of every other word possible to use which made him one of the greats.

EDIT 15: Talking about how he wants to use fashion to abolish bullying. When he got new Jordans when he was younger he was the most popular kid in school that day - wants that influence in the fashion world.

EDIT 16: He doesn't like V-necks

EDIT 17: **They're about to replay that new single** - talking about what to call the song: Champions, Wear a Crown, Round and Round - Which one do you like?

EDIT 18: PLAYING THAT YE BUTTON

EDIT 19: PLAYING RUNAWAY 🙏  HE'S RAPPING TO THE BEAT LIVE ON THE RADIO LMAO

EDIT 20: When he started singing the chorus Big Boy joined in and Ye said ""I didn't ask for back up"" - Cold as hell.

EDIT 21: FLASHING LIGHTS LIVE - ok he going scatman now

EDIT 22: Talking about how he has to be himself, he's gotta do his thing - ""You need a guy like me in the game! You need a guy who isn't watered down. I'm 38 and I'm still YE."" ""If I tried to be someone else my whole career, I wouldn't be sitting here today""

EDIT 23: Classic Kanye rant right now.

EDIT 24: Talking about fatherhood: he loves it, wants to listen and learn/wants to know what his daughter is learning so he can make the best life possible. Said he is a very protective father. Apparently left Nike to Adidas for North - there was an opportunity to grow. There was love and respect at Adidas, and wanted to make a better atmosphere for his daughter.

EDIT 25: Doesn't want to be doing songs like ""Gold Digger"" at 40. He needs to grow as a person and an artist. 

EDIT 26: **YE BUTTON AGAIN DAMN SON**

EDIT 27: https://twitter.com/trvisXX/status/738757641338421251 - Travis Scott wrote the song 3 years ago

EDIT 28: Ye gonna see what people are saying on the internet then decide a name.

EDIT 29 : They have roughly 7 tracks for the album right now.

EDIT 30: It's important to have friendly competition in the game. 

EDIT 31: He had the working title for TLOP (SHMG/SWISH/WAVES), then he saw the work, ""and it named itself"".

EDIT 32:""It was just a feeling like a sonic painting""

EDIT 33: Big Boy trying to get Kanye to call Kim so they can do father's day all together...lol

EDIT 34: **YE BUTTON #4**

EDIT 35: Isn't offended by comments on social media - he likes them, finds them hilarious. Hypebeast is one of his favourite sites. Comments about kids/kim are step too far though.

EDIT 36: Wants to leave a legacy. Feels blessed with his opportunities - ""still scoring 60 12-13 years in"". 

EDIT 37: ""Only artists, no critics""

* At Robeson High School, Chance the Rapper announced ""The New Chance Arts & Literature Fund"" to help raise money for arts programs in Chicago Public Schools (CPS). **[You can get more info about the fund and donate here.](http://www.socialworkschi.org/supportcps)**

* For every $100,000 raised, [Social Works Chicago](http://www.socialworkschi.org) (Chance's nonprofit organization) will donate an additional $10,000 to a Chicago public school.

* [The Chicago Bulls have matched the $1 million that Chance donated to CPS on March 6th.](https://twitter.com/chicagobulls/status/847895518210555904) Others who have donated to CPS include the Corcoran Family Foundation, Scooter Braun, Hannibal Buress, and [Sky Zone](https://www.skyzone.com/). 

* Since his initial donation, Chance has now raised $2.2 million for CPS.

* This is all following [a meeting that Chance had with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chance-the-rapper-bruce-rauner-met-0304-20170303-story.html), who vetoed a funding bill in December that would have provided $215 million to CPS. Following this move, CPS was forced to freeze budgets and furlough employees and claimed that cuts to summer school could follow.

Everyone knows *it aint a hit till Nate Dogg spits*. Nate Dogg was G-funk and G-funk was Nate Dogg. The lifestyle, the voice, the bandanna on the top of his bald head, the man was rap icon who is sorely missed in this industry. 

[G-Funk Classics Vol. 1 & 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92A60y18qc)

I do not know how many people on this subreddit have heard this album but, if you havent, yall fuckin up heavy! G-Funk Classics is an incredible double album, filled with pure Southern California style. There is nothing better than playing this album at baby showers, BBQs, quinceaneras, Confirmation parties, it is pure West Coast to the fullest.

don't buy the new yung lean album,4375,42i5by,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 42i5by dont_buy_the_new_yung_lean_album ,435,1453675054.0,"edit: if you're gonna comment saying no one is gonna buy the album shut the fuck up you aren't funny and you're definitely not original

[so someone found a preorder on amazon of the album with 30 second previews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AZGA8SC?ie=UTF8&keywords=Yung%20Lean&qid=1453582800&ref_=sr_1_2&s=dmusic&sr=1-2-mp3-albums-bar-strip-0) with some weird ass cover art, which isn't the same as the one he posted on instagram.

someone came on the subreddit /r/sadboys who is close to yung lean (i confirmed this, he is a producer that has helped produce a lean track) and said these are rough demos from almost 1.5 years ago that someone got and is trying to sell to make a quick buck.

the version of creepin' that you can preview on the preorder isn't the same as [the one we got last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFn1tXvHsJg
)

MORE PROOF: [woesum tweeted it, dude who produced ghostrider]( https://twitter.com/_woesum_/status/691457827852800001), [as well as acea, another dude who lives in sweden and is close with yung lean, produced 2seats by thaiboy digital](https://twitter.com/aceaswe/status/691253948909535232)
literally all of the songs sound rough as shit and don't even sound like they're finished being autotuned.

someone also asked yung gud on twitter if it was official, he replied ""wtf no"" but deleted the tweet fast as fuck. i saw it though.

then this morning, the same album got posted on [itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/album/warlord-this-record-is-dedicated/id1077868535)

so yeah, don't get ripped off and don't buy this album.

oc what does dj khaled do?,4349,6tfpg0,reddit  r hiphopheads ments 6tfpg0 oc_what_does_dj_khaled_do ,374,1502638306.0,"Many people ask what does DJ Khaled actually do? Well I could go into great detail on what I think he does on creating his albums, but I’d rather give you the history of Khaled in music videos. No I’m not talking about Khaled’s own music videos where he can drive down 95 backwards in a bently with Rozzay in [We Takin Ova](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/ConstantGlumHamster),breaking through windows in [Fed Up](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/RawNegativeAmericankestrel) or telling his girl to now call him Billy [Do You Mind](https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/PoliteHonorableGallowaycow). No, I’m not talking about the first golden age of Khaled where an artists would have a remix and Khaled would shout out everyone’s name at the beginning like [Foolish Remix](https://gfycat.com/CourageousFixedGoitered),  [Rockin That Thang Remix](https://gfycat.com/AggressiveFluffyFruitfly), or [100 Million](https://gfycat.com/WildBlandCowrie). I’m talking about the music videos where I’m pretty sure he had nothing to do with the song and is in the video anyways.

Now you may think everyone does cameos in other music videos if there around but I’mma show you in this timeline that noone does it better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Back in the year 2000 Khaled was hosting a radio show in Miami under the name Arab Attak and decided to bless us with his first video cameo in Big Pun’s first video after his death(RIP to one of the greatest)[It’s So Hard](https://gfycat.com/TepidTidyBabirusa).

A year later we find our boy going back to the name we all love in his first Fat Joe music video doing his signutare jump into water with his clothes on in [We Thuggin](https://gfycat.com/ComposedKindlyHagfish). A few years go by as Khaled now has his own show as the hottest DJ in Miami until in 2004 we see Khaled lookin fresh in pink in Fat Joe’s biggest hit [Lean Back](https://gfycat.com/OptimisticRectangularEskimodog). In 2005 Khaled’s back at it again showin off the freshest moves the world has ever seen in Fat Joe’s [So Much More](https://gfycat.com/TartIdioticCormorant), but Khaled makes what some might be considered the greatest move of his career by donning his cameo in his first ever non Terror Squad video by posting up the chair in Miami’s own Trick Daddy [Suga](https://gfycat.com/TenderAgonizingIndianringneckparakeet).

The year is 2006 and knowing the world needs a break from the Khaledmania as it were by Khaled only giving us one video but luckily it came in a form of a tribute to the OG Fonsworth Bentley in in Fat Joe’s [Make It Rain](https://gfycat.com/EverlastingSilentBluebird). Knowing he had to do what people only ever imagined could be possible in 2007 Khaled completes the famed 4YFJS(4 Year Fat Joe Streak) by popping bottles in [I Won’t Tell](https://gfycat.com/FragrantBlackandwhiteAmurminnow). And as always Khaled shows love for Miami showing up in, The 2007 Ozone Awards Winner For Best Rap/R&B Collaboration, Plies’s [Shawty](https://gfycat.com/BlankThriftyAztecant). 

By this point as we all know Khaled is on top of the world, but like Rich Homie Quan once said “I Promise I Will Never Stop Going In”, and I like to believe Khaled saw into the future and took this line to heart and knew it was time to expand outside Miami and start moving north ending up all the way in Tallahasee in T-Pain’s [Chopped N Screwed](https://gfycat.com/DistortedCoarseBarasingha). But like we know Khaletto will always take it to another level and decided to rep the international circuit deciding to help rep the mysterious city of Ontario in Kardinall Offishal’s [Dangerous](https://gfycat.com/JoyousHomelyIndianabat) in 2008. Note: I’m pretty sure this video was filmed in Jamaica but I don’t know what foreign countries look like and will just assume they are the same place.

Recieving the first backlash of his career for not showing up in artists video that are from Miami Khaled not only decided to double but quadruple down showing up in 4 videos in the year 2009. Watching a movie in [Lay Back](https://gfycat.com/YellowishImpressionableHammerkop). Stopping the whole fashion world with [Magnificent](https://gfycat.com/AgreeableHugeEel). Cookin up that fire in [Overtime](https://gfycat.com/WatchfulIcyArrowana) and finally rockin the purple in [Ride Or Die](https://gfycat.com/ThickElasticHarpyeagle). But noone expected what would happen next in 2010 and only Khaled himself knows the true story in what the media dubbed “The Blackout” as Khaled went missing for the year.

2011 was a modest year for the Terror Squadian with only one entry but decided to give us a million frames and 2 siezures in [Hustle Hard Remix](https://gfycat.com/OrnateAdeptAmericanrobin). And I  believe this warmup was needed since 2012 came to shatter records. As Khaled, for his 5 year anniversary of the completion of the 4YFJS, gave us “The Nod For Nuvo” from [Pride And Joy](https://gfycat.com/SilverOrangeBluetickcoonhound). Next up Khaled drops another Miami anthem reppin the set in [Stay Schemin](https://gfycat.com/AcidicGoodnaturedBushbaby) and follows Drake from the video up north to give his nod of approval in [HYFR](https://gfycat.com/WeightyDirtyAmurratsnake). So for those of you keeping score this is the only Khaled ever completed(1 Terror Squad, 1 Miami,1 Outside Florida).

2013 Khaled is once again on top of the world and decideds to double down on Ace Hood Reppin the Heat in [We Outchea](https://gfycat.com/ImmediateAssuredAztecant) and showin off his pyrotechnic skills in [Bugatti](https://gfycat.com/CheerfulBitterDeer). Now repping YMCMB it was only right he’d celebrate on XXL’s #18 Best Song of 2013 with some insane kaleidoscope skills in [Tapout](https://gfycat.com/AdeptOffbeatBlackpanther). And to once again throw us for an unexpected curve Khaled decided to appear in a New York non Terror Squad video on Busta’s [Twerk It](https://gfycat.com/BrokenCelebratedIntermediateegret). I for one didn’t believe other New York rappers could handle the appearance but I thought Busta and Nicki did an admirable job. 

After seeing the world go into a frenzy after Twerk It, Khaled in 2014 decided to hit us with another one appearing with the fuzziest jacket known to man in Diddy’s [Big Homie](https://gfycat.com/AngelicBestGoat). You heard that right Khaled repped 2 different New Yorkers in a row. But as the genious knew to not get too cocky Khaled kept it real help making it rain for Ross in [Keep Doing That](https://gfycat.com/ActiveFatKusimanse). 2015 was a quieter year only showing off the necklace in [I Know How It Feel](https://gfycat.com/LightComposedKinglet), but just cause Khaled hit a lul we knew he’d be back better than ever.

2016 as we all remember was a year of celebration for being the 10 year anniversary for what some called the greatest album of all time Listen…. The Album. To start it out Khaled decided to bring the reunion we all had been waiting for in Fat Joe’s  [All The Way Up](https://gfycat.com/IllGrossDrever). Next up Khaled decideds to do the celebration tour going to 2 new cities Chance’s Chicago with [No Problems](https://gfycat.com/OffbeatSnoopyCanadagoose) and to give us the line heard around the world “Major Key Alert: Prenup” in [Down In The DM](https://gfycat.com/WavyGiganticAmericanavocet). Ive heard reports that people are still lauging to this line to this day. Since the line we still haven’t seen anything else into 2017 many a blog has speculated that Khaled can’t top this, but as we’ve seen before Khaled has broken boundries hundreds of time and I am excited to see what he has cooked up next.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Also if you have any other videos appearances with Khaled let me know so I can keep this blessed timeline up to date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

**TLDR**: Khaled does music videos cameos better than no other

EDIT: Thanks /u/Kaleem7 Khaled decided to bless us with a west coast cameo in [Ali Bomaye](https://gfycat.com/LeafyGlumHoverfly) in 2013

EDIT 2: Thanks to/u/Cazeltherunner Khaled actually showed up Miami in 2004 in [Let's Go](https://gfycat.com/UltimateHeavyFrigatebird)

Edit 3: Thanks to /u/irish91 we got Khaled riding passenger to Ross in 2007 in [Speeding](https://gfycat.com/FoolishIndolentKingsnake) and /u/sera-pppp for finding the first appearance in a Busta video in [Arab Money](https://gfycat.com/InferiorThirstyHeterodontosaurus) in 2008 and Khaled up on the big screen in [Shawty Get Loose](https://gfycat.com/SoftMassiveCaiman) in 2007 and /u/BmebossMn for catching Khaled grinding up on a girl in [Feeling On Your Body](https://gfycat.com/SpeedySilentFinch) way back in 2000.

Article: http://www.details.com/story/hip-hop-artist-kanye-west-talks-fashion-and-music

Actually really interesting read, all clickbait sex video game quotes aside.

---

Kanye's a straight A student, studied in China as a kid, coded and designed video games for fun, won an art scholarship for his painting talent and then did an English degree before dropping out of college to pursue his music.

Debt Problems:

>West has had his own clothing line, Pastelle, for three years, and the fashion world has exacted its pound of flesh from him much as he once did from drug dealers eager to make it as producers. 

>""The big payback,"" he calls it. **""I work with different designers and they'll see me coming, saying 'I wanna do this line,' and they're like, 'Cool, give me $150,000 for two weeks' work'! It's like, 'This dude is so eager to get in—he's a millionaire who doesn't know his ass from his face, and we're gonna charge him up the fucking ass for a sketch, for an idea, for a sample.'** 

>**Every time I did a sample line—it was over a quarter-million.""**

>Like the 12-year-old who lost nights to making a penis take a step, West is no dilettante playing at fashion design. He'll spend an hour in a Jil Sander store scrutinizing collars, devote days to freehand sketches. ""I'm 31. I study now,"" he says, flipping through a designer's book, catching everything: the flow of material at the elbow crease of a jacket, the same face shape on different models. ",2016-02-14 17:18:53,1

Sadly, a few of the entries have been deleted so I wasn't able to get ALL of them, but I did my best.  If you happen to know what some of the missing weeks are, **please let me know**.

----

I love music.  My mother taught me violin and piano from a young age.  I frequently attended classical music concerts (she performed in an orchestra) and basically I was trained to listen to music my whole life.  As I got older my tastes got pretty diverse but I mainly focused on the ""indie"" music scene.  Everyone from Dirty Projectors, to Animal Collective, to of Montreal, to Franz Ferdinand, to Tallest Man on Earth.  I love folk, bluegrass, alt rock, indie rock, pop, ambient, swing house, electronica, etc.  For a long time I would say ""I love everything but country and rap.""  My distaste for country still thrives, but my thoughts on rap and hip hop has changed... a ton.

So, when you look at the spreadsheet and the ratings I've put in for each album... please realize that those ratings come from someone who has NO context for the music.  My entire experience with music is outlined above, and hip hop is missing.  I'm a white boy from the north east... I like Eminem.  Stereotypical as fuck, fam.  I don't know who *anybody* is, I have no idea what the significance of the albums are, and I always rated the albums BEFORE I read the discussion thread.

#**[The Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hIPzgUlPMdHx0wA5HWr4UBs0tLNxN0Q-tjerSS_1JXA/edit?usp=sharing)**  
*Column K is how much I liked the album.*

On the third page of The Spreadsheet, I have charts, copied below into imgur:

* [How close to a bell curve I got with my ratings](http://imgur.com/b5A5ZLC)  I'm very pleased with this chart.  It was extremely challenging to choose a rating that was relative to all the other ratings I had given out.  While it's not a perfect bell curve, it's a lot closer than I thought I would get.

* [Where did the albums in the list come from?](http://imgur.com/4XahY6B)  Somewhat unsurprisingly, New York was by far the most common state that groups hailed from.  NY had 44 albums, CA 21, and MI 10.  Everyone else was fewer than 7, and any state with fewer than 3 I grouped together into ""other"".

* [Are my ratings different based on location?](http://imgur.com/ZwcGaVS)  Yes!  I was surprised by this one.  I thought I would have a very heavy bias towards New York because I thought I enjoyed more music from there, but I'm a bigger fan of west coast than I realized.  Georgia especially surprised me, because I'm NOT a fan of ""dirty south"" style... but with OutKast, Ludacris, and Arrested Development being 3 of the 4 albums from Georgia... how could it not be rated highly?  Also, fuck Chicago (except for Common).

Fun stuff:

* Four artists showed up twice: Freddie Gibbs, Billy Woods, DJ Quik, Pharoahe Monch.  One artist showed up three times: 8Ball & MJG.  Of the repeaters, I only gave the same ranking each time to DJ Quik (6).  He's consistently Not Bad.

* It took about 5 months to listen to all of these.

* I only gave out one 10 (Cypress Hill), but I gave out two 1s... to dälek and Yung Lean.  My notes on the latter were ""this is terrible. I went back and rated other things better because of how bad this was.""  So, uh... yeah.  Get got, /r/sadboys.

* After listening to all of these, my favorites are probably Cities Aviv, Ratking, Death Grips, Jeru the Demaja, and Billy Woods.  Maybe.  Definitely Ratking and Death Grips, those guys are fucking awesome.

* I'm going to start listening to the [Essential Album List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewEzXRHj8LGvUB3g9QbnIK_m89I2Q5Y2LzsgqKOG6Xg/edit#gid=0) and make another similar spreadsheet for it... probably should have done that first.

**tl;dr: I listened to a lot of hip hop and I ~~hate~~ strongly dislike Yung Lean's music.**

Edit: the google sheet was getting a LOT of traffic, so it displays in html only mode.  I added a new tab with different formatting so you can actually see my comments if you wanted to.  :)

Edit: **there is an AWESOME chart [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/447zif/discussion_knowing_almost_nothing_about_hip_hop_i/czovsoj) from /u/A_Wild_Viz_Appeared**

Edit: this blew up overnight.  Thank you everyone for your opinions, understanding, and suggestions.  I have a TON of music to listen to now, not the least of which is essentials albums, modern essentials, and (according to some) every single one of these albums all over again.  <3",2016-02-04 17:25:31,1

We are going to be losing my father to cancer in the coming days to weeks.  I'm going through a lot of songs to try and make a video for his funeral.   There are great clips from a lot of songs I will use, along with all of ""My Old Man"" by zack brown.  

But Drive by Alan Jackson.  Well it's just so touching.  Anyone whoever grew up learning how to drive from a parent at a young age, this song hits so close to home.  

My father drove me in his bronco every night to put me to sleep.  By the time I was 5 I was steering his pickup down the mile long entrance road to the quarry he worked at.  At 10 he got me a go kart.  He would have preferred a sprint car but momma wasn't going to let us go racing.  By the time I turned 16 we finished our first dune buggy together. And who got the maiden voyage?   Well, my dad did but it ended with the steering linkage coming apart first run out.  Who got the first successful drive?  I did.  

Daddy always let me drive.  Alan Jackson's song Drive couldn't be any more perfect and relating.  I've heard the song for years and have always loved it.  But it's hitting close to home. We were huge racing fans and I always dreamed about being a NASCAR driver. When Alan says ""I was Mario Andretti when daddy let me drive.""  Well I never realized just how accurate that was.  

I hope this isn't a shit post. It's just a great country song.  ",2017-12-07 00:15:23,0

---------------------------------------------------------------

Many years back, much like Willie and Waylon had years before, Merle Haggard said,

""Fuck this town. I'm moving."" and he left Nashville.

According to my sources, it was right after a record executive told him that ""Kern River"" was a bad song. In the last chapter of his career and his life, Nashville wouldn't call, play, or touch him. He felt forgotten and tossed aside. I always got a sense that he wanted one last hit..one last proper victory lap of his own, and we all know deserved it. Yet it never came. And now he's gone.
Im writing this because I want to go on record and say I find it utterly disgusting the way everybody on Music Row is coming up with any reason they can to hitch their wagon to his name while knowing full and damn well what he thought about them. If the ACM wants to actually celebrate the legacy and music of Merle Haggard, they should drop all the formulaic cannon fodder bullshit they've been pumping down rural America's throat for the last 30 years along with all the high school pageantry, meat parade award show bullshit and start dedicating their programs to more actual Country Music.

While Im venting about the unjust treatment of a bonafide American music legend, I should also add, if for no other reasons than sheer principal and to get the taste I've been choking back for months now out of my mouth, that Merle was supposed to be on the cover of Garden & Gun magazine's big Country Music issue (along with myself) a few months back. 

They reached out to both of us in October of last year while I was on a west coast tour. Merle was home off the road so I took a day off and traveled up to Redding.

He was so excited about it and it goes without saying that I was completely beside myself along with my Grandfather who has always been a HUGE Merle fan. We spent the whole day of the interview visiting in his living room with our families and had a wonderful conversation with the journalist. Then we spent about two hours outside being photographed by a brilliant and highly respected photographer named David McClister until Merle had enough...he was still recovering from a recent bout of double pneumonia at the time and it was a bit cold that day on the ranch. 
But then at the last minute, the magazine's editor put Chris Stapleton on the cover without telling anyone until they had already gone to print. Don't get me wrong, Chris had a great year and deserves a million magazine covers...but thats not the point. 
Its about keeping your word and ethics.

Chris also knows this as he called me personally to express his disgust at the situation. Dude's a class act.

The editor later claimed in a completely bullshit email apology to both Merle's publicist and ours (Chris and I share the same publicist) that they didn't get any good shots that day.

David McClister..

2 hour shoot..

no good photos..

OK buddy,..whatever you say.

Anyway, Merle passed away right after it came out.

Some days, this town and this industry have a way of making we wish I could just go sit on Mars and build glass clocks.

Sturgill

UPDATED:
Shortly after I initially posted this it was announced that Miranda Lambert would be the award recipient. 

Before people start chasing clickbait by putting words in my mouth I feel the need to clarify that I was not aware of this at the time of my original post and my words were in no way directed at her. I know that Merle liked and respected her so it's good to see there is at least some blue sky in all of this.

I don't know Miranda nor have I ever met her but something tells me that in her heart, she knows I'm dead on. I am also aware that the ACM is a West Coast organization originally created to recognize West Coast artists like Merle and they have handed Merle many trophies over the years,..even in the last 15 or so mind you. It's also worth noting that the last one was handed to him by none other than Miranda Lambert herself.

But all of this is irrelevant as none of it has anything to do with the original point I was trying to make. My point was that that all of these organizations don't walk it like they talk it. I called The ACM out directly because they are simply the latest in a long line of organizations that have done the same since Merle's death...and even before. Showing homage and handing lifetime achievement awards to the greats of yesterday while claiming to uphold and hold dear the original values and integrity of Country music's legacy. Yet these are just hollow words...merely empty semantics. One needs only to look glancingly at the majority of the music that they, along with the CMA's, predominantly choose to recognize and promote at their award shows.

I fully realize that as I type this, meetings and conversations are taking place on music Row to ensure I am blackballed from the industry and that's perfectly fine with me. Im not sure how you can blackball somebody you don't acknowledge in the first place. Yet, even though they go out of their way to ignore artists like myself and Jason Isbell, I assure you they are more than aware of our existence.

They are also well aware that we don't need them. Our last albums went to #1 without any help from the Mainstream Country Music establishment...and our next albums will too. With that said, I have no more need to make enemies with these people than I have a need to be their friends. If anything I'm trying to help them. Because more and more everyday, people are waking up to the situation and they are pissed. Perhaps Country Music, especially Nashville, should wake up too before it's too late.

Mostly though, I just wish Merle was still alive. 

I'd love for them to all hear his thoughts on the matter.

P.S. Fuck this town. I'm moving.",2016-08-29 17:17:25,0

You can drink to it, love to it, drive to it. In my opinion, however, country music is just about at its best when it's sad. The steel guitar, the fiddle, and the whine of a good song can make you cry better than anything out there.

So what all do you guys consider the ""saddest country songs""? I'm interested to hear, and I'll leave a very small list of my own.

(Especially late 80's early 90's country) I wrote this bit about how even though a lot of people say they don't like country music, they actually secretly love it. It's still a work in progress but it's the joke I love telling the most right now. Mostly because making fun of country is so hacky I wanted to take a stab at pulling off a proudly pro country music joke. It's not the best video and as I mentioned I'm still tweaking it but I wanted to put it out there and see what some unabashed country fans think of it. Thanks!

My dad loved country music, which is why I am coming to you for help.

He loved country music, USA, beer and the cowboy lifestyle. I've lost count of how many times he travelled from Norway to the States, and sometimes he would be gone for several months.

He would drive up and down Route 66, Lincoln Highway and other historic roads. He would stop by pubs and taverns, and loved a good concert or festival. I think he travelled to Surf Ballroom's Winter Dance Party about 6 or 7 times.

His musical idol was Waylon Jennings. Other artists worth mentioning are Johnny Cash, David Allan Coe, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, George Jones, Kris Kristofferson and Rolling Stones.

He didn't have a wife or girlfriend, because he cherished his freedom too much.

Are there any songs by the mentioned artists that speak of a lonesome, travelling music loving man like this, that might fit a funeral. He loved life and all it had to offer, until he passed away 73 years old.

Hope you all can give me some tips. He also worked as a sailor for many years, so songs about the sea might work.

Thank you, and sorry for rambling. This was kind of therapeutic.",2018-04-16 16:34:05,0

cool story about johnny cash i thought i'd share,35,2txljl,reddit  r country ments 2txljl cool_story_about_johnny_cash_i_thought_id_share ,10,1422422513.0,"So I was just talking to my dad while we were driving and Folsom Prison Blues comes on and I go ""oh I love this song""

After an exchange of ""how do you know johnny cash"" etc etc he tells me that my grandfather (now passed)  met him, how you ask?

He was a field doctor in the Vietnam War and Johnny Cash came to visit and pay his respect to the troops as well as comfort those who were in pain and/or dying. So Johnny comes in and he sees a young man laying on one of the cots who is very close to death. He walks over and sits down next to him and starts playing the song ""Grazin in Greener Pastures"" to this guy until he passes away. 

And then according to my Grandfather, he said a prayer and as he walked out turned around and says ""God Bless you all"" and leaves

When my Grandfather came back from the war, he was a huge Johnny Cash fan and listened to him all the time around the house which is when he told my dad the story

So thats it, I thought it was cool and thought maybe some of y'all would think it was cool to",2015-01-27 23:21:53,0

is country music in a slump? or is it just me?,31,9x7fhf,reddit  r country ments 9x7fhf is_country_music_in_a_slump_or_is_it_just_me ,40,1542252951.0,"Hey y’all. Gotta quick question that I hope you all give your opinion on. About 5 or 6 years ago I began to become a huge country music fan. I was raised in the city, so a lot of my friends weren’t fans like I was. However when I went away for college, I met a ton of people who loved country music. We would frequent college country bars and hit up concerts all the time. 

However, over the last year or so- I’ve found that I’m not enjoying the music as much. I turn on the country station in the car and it’s just the same songs over and over. I’m sitting here now watching the CMA’s and I hate to say it, but there really hasn’t been a stand out act the entire night. Chris Stapleton wins every award. Brad Paisley just sang what I thought was a very corny song based on George Straits “cowboy rides away” classic. 

I’m starting to think that maybe it’s just me. Maybe because I’m not longer having a good time at college going out to country bars all the time and associating the songs with great times but instead just driving home from work. That could very well be. Or it really is true that the country talent is running a little thin of late. 

What do you think? All opinions welcome and please be honest! ",2018-11-14 21:35:51,0

Obviously that's not the *tone* of the song, but if you listen to the lyrics, that's what I'm getting. The characters are the butt of the joke; ""I'm a simple girl myself/ Grew up on Long Island""

Eric Church with a more modern, contemporary sound, Chris Stapleton with a raw, bluesy style of country, Simpson with his almost psychedelic country sound and Jason with a softer rock sound, branching into a little more rock with ""The Nashville Sound"".

can i say something positive here about country music?,29,7ztncu,reddit  r country ments 7ztncu can_i_say_something_positive_here_about_country ,31,1519439543.0,"I am not a huge country fan, but more of a low key country fan, but not from modern country. I am a musician and my primary favorite genres metal, rock (classic a modern), and blues, but I grew up on country music and have a secret love for 90's and early-to-mid 2000's.


I was born in '91 and my mother listened to a country station and I remember some killer tracks like:


*  Brad Paisely - ""Celebrity""
* Toby Keith - ""I Love this bar"", ""I want to talk about me"", and ""Whiskey for my men, beer for my horses""
*  Alan Jackson - Every song by him damnit!
* Diamond Rio - Beautiful Mess
* George Straight - ""Write This Down"", ""I Hate Everything"", more 

.....and too many to count.

My mother bought an Alan Jackson Greatest Hits (1) CD when I was maybe 10 - 12 years old and every song was so good. I am not in the country music circle or know any of my friends that listen to country, but is Alan Jackson considered the best in country music? The thing that also makes Jackson appealing is that he was a post office worker turned country music legend. He was a normal ""joe"" so to speak. How cool is that? 


It common for people to not like current country music but really like country music from 2006 (or so) to back? From the songs I listed, would you recommend anything for me? I am not into ""pop country"" like Rascal Flatts. I hope you all know what I mean by this, lol.


I like really old country music as well. There was a video game called ""Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas"" (I am sure you have heard it), in the game, there was a radio station called ""K-Rose"". This radio station had gems like:


* Asleep At The Wheel - ""The Letter That Johnny Walker Read""
* Ed Bruce - ""Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys""
*  Whitey Shafer - ""All My Ex's Live in Texas"" (George Straight version is better)
* Eddie Rabbitt - ""I Love a Rainy Night""

and more great tracks. 


Anyway, I never talk about country music to anyone and just wanted to have this discussion. I feel like country music in general is overlooked by people and underrated (referring to 2006-past here, keep in mind). It is common for people to say ""I listen to everything except country and rap."" I am wondering if anyone shares the same sentiment with me.",2018-02-23 20:32:23,0

If anyone else has heard this new album, what do you think so far.  

I'm really enjoying it.  They didn't lose what made the three of them compelling and I'm impressed with Lambert wanting to bring the group back together even after she's had quite a solo career.  I was looking forward to Cody Jinks new album this year the most, but I think I like this album a bit better.  ",2018-11-03 12:50:12,0

I’ve listened to country my whole life. Started with listening to Johnny Cash with my dad. When I first started listening to music on my own it was pretty much what was popular. Early to mid 2000’s stuff mostly, Toby Kieth, Brad Paisley, Kenny Chesney, etc. As I got older I went back to older country and haven’t looked back. For the past years I’ve listened to Cal Smith, Don Williams, Marty Robbins, Glen Campbell, etc. 

Every once in awhile I come across a song I haven’t heard and love it. Just wondering what your all time favorites are. Or maybe ones that you like a lot that people don’t really know of. Mostly looking for old country but there’s still a spot in my heart for 2000’s country. ",2018-09-24 20:20:58,0

Im not looking for mainstream ""Lets have a house party"" or Taylor Swift stuff (if shes still considered a country singer.)

Something more philosophical, lyrics with deeper meanings behind them. Something that sounds more complex than your average country song. I tend to prefer more personal, melancholic music if that helps.

The one country song i don't mind is Remember When by Alan Jackson.

I can deal with a bit of pop, but I cant stand the country lyrics over a completely electronic beat that just repeats. Any suggestions?

So, why isn't there more honky-tonk and cowboy music on the radio nowadays? Why is it filled with ""bro pop?"" There is apparently a very large demand for country music that isn't created with electronic beats and auto tune. I know the ol ""music changes"" thing, I understand it.
